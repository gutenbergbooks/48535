<p>A sea-wall of solid masonry, a rampart upon
whose flat top we may walk at will, presents itself
to the winds and spray that blow in from the
Gulf of Darien upon the ancient city of Cartagena,
and the booming of the waves there, in times of
storm, might be the echo of the guns of Drake,
for this rampart was raised along the shore in
those days when he and other famous sea rovers
ranged the Spanish Main, over which Cartagena
still looks out.</p>

<p>Cartagena was a rich city in those days, the
outlet for the gold and silver and other seductive
matters of New Granada, under the viceroys, and
the buccaneers knew it well, this tempting bait
of a treasure storehouse and haven of the Plate
ships. This, then, was the reason for the massive
sea-wall, one of the strongest and oldest of the
Spanish fortifications of the New World, which
Spain had monopolized and which the sea rovers
disputed.</p>

<p>There is a certain Mediterranean aspect about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Cartagena, which was named by its founder,
the Spaniard, Pedro de Heredia, in 1533, after
the Spanish city of Carthage, founded by the
Ph&oelig;nicians of the famous Carthage of Africa.
The steamer on which we have journeyed has
crossed the American Mediterranean, as the
Caribbean has been not altogether fancifully
termed, for there is a certain analogy with the
original, and passing the islands and entering the
broad channel brings into view the ancient and
picturesque town, with the finest harbour on the
northern coast of the continent, a smooth, land-locked
bay, with groups of feathery palms upon
its shores.</p>

<p>Backed by the verdure-clad hills&mdash;whereon the
better-class residents have their homes, thereby
escaping the malarias of the littoral&mdash;the walls and
towers of the town arise, and, entering, we are
impressed by a certain old-world dignity and
massiveness of the place, a one-time home of the
viceroy and of the Inquisition. There are many
memories of the past here of interest to the
English traveller. Among these stands out the
attempt of Admiral Vernon, in 1741, who with a
large naval force and an army&mdash;under General
Wentworth&mdash;arrived expecting an outpost of the
place, which Drake had so easily held to ransom,
to fall readily before him. The attempt was a
failure, otherwise the British Empire might have
been established upon this coast.</p>

<p>Colombia, like Mexico, has been a land of what
might be termed vanished hopes and arrested development.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
But the old land of New Granada,
as Colombia was earlier termed, has not the weight
of wasted opportunity and outraged fortune which
now envelops the land of New Spain, which in
our generation promised so much and fell from
grace. Colombia, by a slower path, may yet reach
a greater height than Mexico as an exponent of
Spanish American culture.</p>

<p>But a century ago, at the time Colombia freed
herself, in company with her neighbours, from the
rule of Spain, her statesmen as well as her neighbours
hailed her as a favoured land upon which
fortune was to shine, which was to lead in industrial
achievement, to redress the balance of the
Old World, to offer liberty and opportunity to
the settler, riches to the trader, to be a centre
of art and thought. At that time, indeed, New
Granada was the leading State in all the newly
born constellation of Spanish America, and during
her earlier republican period one of her orators,
with that command of grandiloquent phrase with
which the Spanish American statesman is endowed,
spoke as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"United, neither the empire of the Assyrians,
the Medes or the Persians, the Macedonian or the
Roman Empire can ever be compared with this
colossal Republic!"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The speaker&mdash;Zea, the vice-president&mdash;was referring
to the Republic of <em>La Gran Colombia</em>,
formed, under Bolivar, of Venezuela, Colombia and
Ecuador&mdash;a union which was soon disrupted and
which neither geography nor human politics could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
have done aught but tend to separate. The union,
like that of Central America, fell asunder amid
strife and bloodshed.</p>

<p>But let us take the road to Bogota, the beautiful
and in many respects highly cultured capital
of Colombia.</p>

<p>We do not, however, take the road, but the river,
starting either from Cartagena by the short railway
to Barranquilla, the seaport at the mouth of
the Magdalena River, or direct from that port,
and thence by the various interrupted stages of
a journey that has become a synonym of varied
travel to a South American capital.</p>

<p>Barranquilla is an important place&mdash;the principal
commercial centre of the Republic. Here
we embark upon a stern-wheel river steamer of
the Mississippi type, flat-bottomed, not drawing
more than three to five feet of water. The smaller
boat, though less pretentious, may sometimes be
the better on the long voyage upstream, and may
pass the bigger and swifter craft if haply, as occurs
at times, that craft be stranded on a shoal. For
the river falls greatly in the dry season.</p>

<p class="marginrightspaced">Vol. II. To face p. 14.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Journeying thus, we reach La Dorada, six
hundred miles upstream, in about nine days, for
there are many obstacles against time on the way,
such as the current, the taking-in of fuel, the sand
bars, which prohibit progress by night, slow discharge
of merchandise and so forth. The heat
may be stifling. A gauze mosquito bar or net
is among the equipment of the prudent traveller,
as is a cot or hammock, and rugs against the chill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and damp of the nights. Also food, for the commissariat
on board often leaves much to be desired.
In Colombia the traveller requires clothing both
light and heavy, as indeed in almost all Spanish
American countries. Quinine, moreover, must
always be among his equipment.</p>

<p>At Puerto Berrio, five hundred miles up the
river, a railway runs to the interesting city of
Medellin, in the mountains, the second city in
importance in Colombia.</p>

<p>There are, from La Dorada, various changes
to be made before Bogota is reached. We must
change to the railway that runs to&mdash;near&mdash;Honda,
circumventing the rapids, a line about twenty miles
long. Here we have a choice of routes and
methods. We may proceed on mule-back through
magnificent scenery and the refreshing atmosphere
of the Andes, with tolerable inns, or we may take
the steamer again to Giradot, on the Upper Magdalena,
and then a further trajectory of eighty
miles by rail. Seven changes are necessary in
this journey from Cartagena to the capital&mdash;ocean-steamer
to train, thence to river-steamer, from
that to the train again, thence to river-steamer
once more, thence to the train, and again to
another train&mdash;doubtless a record of varied travel.</p>

<p>The remote and famous city of Santa Fé de
Bogota, founded by Quesada in 1538, the old
viceregal capital of New Granada, the "Athens
of South America" as some of its admirers have
termed it, stands pleasingly upon its <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Sabana</i>, or
upland plain&mdash;one of the largest cultivated mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
plateaux in the world&mdash;at an elevation of
8,600 feet above sea-level, higher than the famous
city of Mexico. It is in the heart of the Tropics,
but four degrees north of the Equator, and its
equable climate, a result of the offsetting of latitude
by altitude, is in many respects delightful.</p>

<p>Here the typical Spanish American character
is stamped on the city and reflected in the life of
its people, where Parisian dress rubs shoulders
with the blanketed Indian. Here the aristocracy
of Colombia, implanted by Spain, centres. One
street may be lined with the handsome residences
of the correct and elegant upper class, folk perhaps
educated in foreign universities, men of the
world, passing by in silk hat and frock-coat&mdash;attire
beloved of the wealthy here&mdash;or in motor-car or
carriage, which whirls past the groups of half-starved,
half-clothed (and perhaps half-drunken)
Indian or poor Mestizo folk, whose homes are in
the hovels of a neighbouring street and whose
principal source of entertainment is the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chicheria</i>,
or drinking-den, such as exists in profusion. And
without desiring to institute undue comparisons&mdash;for
wealth and misery go side by side in London
or New York, or any city of Christendom&mdash;it may
be pointed out that despite the claim of Bogota
to be a centre of literary thought and high culture,
little more perhaps than a tenth of the population
of Colombia can read and write.</p>

<p>There are handsome plazas, with gardens and
statuary, but few imposing public buildings,
although a certain simplicity is pleasing here. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
streets generally are narrow, and the houses low,
as a precaution against earthquake shocks. The
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Capitiolio</i>, the building of the Legislature, is
spacious and handsome. Upon a marble tablet,
upon its façade, in letters of gold, is an inscription
to the memory of the British Legion, the English
and Irish who lent their aid to Colombia and
Venezuela, under Bolivar, to secure independence
from Spain a century or more ago.</p>

<p>The story of the British soldiers in this liberation
is an interesting one.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With insubordination and murmurings among
his own generals, decreased troops and depleted
treasure, and without the encouragement of decisive
victories to make good these deficiencies,
the outlook for Bolivar and for the cause in which
he was fighting might well have disheartened him
at this time. In March, however, Colonel Daniel
O'Leary had arrived with the troops raised by
Colonel Wilson in London, consisting largely of
veterans of the Napoleonic wars. These tried
soldiers, afterwards known as the British Legion,
were destined to play an all-important part in the
liberation of Venezuela, and Bolivar soon recognized
their value, spending the time till December
in distributing these new forces to the best
advantage.</p>

<p>"Elections were arranged in the autumn, and
on February 15, 1819, Congress was installed in
Angostura. Bolivar took the British Constitution
as his model, with the substitute of an elected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
president for an hereditary king, and was himself
proclaimed provisional holder of the office. The
hereditary form of the Senate was, however, soon
given up."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before the Conquest Bogota was the home of
the Chibchas people&mdash;Tunja was their northern
capital&mdash;the cultured folk of Colombia, who,
although inferior to the Incas of Peru, had their
well-built towns and a flourishing agriculture and
local trade, their temples of no mean structure,
with an advanced religion which venerated and
adored the powers of Providence as represented
by Nature; who worked gold and silver and ornaments
of jewels beautifully and skilfully, such
things as Quesada's Spaniards coveted&mdash;a culture
which knew how to direct the Indian population,
but which, alas! fell before the invaders as all
other early American cultures fell.</p>

<p>To-day, as then, the high mountains look down
upon the Sabana, and the rills of clear water
descend therefrom. Still the beautiful Mesa de
Herveo, the extinct volcano, displays like a great
tablecloth from a giant table its gleaming mantle
of perpetual snow, over 3,000 feet of white
drapery. Still the emerald mines of Muzo yield
their emeralds, and still the patient Indian cultivates
the many foods and fruits which Nature has
so bountifully lavished upon his fatherland.</p>

<p>Colombia, like Peru or Mexico, or Ecuador or
other of the sisterhood of nations in our survey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
is a land of great contrasts, whether of Nature or
man. The unhealthy lowlands of the coast give
place to the delightful valleys of higher elevations,
which in their turn merge into the bitter cold
of the melancholy <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">paramos</i>, or upland passes, and
tablelands of the Andes. Or the cultivated
lands pass to savage forests, where roam tribes
of natives who perhaps have never looked upon
the face of the white man.</p>

<p>Every product of Nature in these climates is
at hand or possible, and the precious minerals
caused New Granada to be placed high on the
roll of gold-producing colonies of the Indies. The
coffee of the lowlands, the bananas, shipped so
largely from the pretty port of Santa Marta, the
cotton, the sugar and the cocoa, grown so far
mainly for home consumption; the coconuts, the
ivory-nuts&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tagua</i>, or coróza, for foreign use in
button-making largely&mdash;the rice, the tobacco, the
quinine, of which shipments have been considerable;
the timber, such as cedar and mahogany; the
cattle and hides, the gold, silver, platinum, copper,
coal, emeralds, cinnabar, lead, the iron and petroleum&mdash;such
are the chief products of this favoured
land.</p>

<p>Many of the mines and railways are under
British control, but in general trade German interests
have been strong, and the German has
identified himself, after his custom, with the
domestic life of the Republic. A rich flora, including
the beautiful orchids, is found here, as
in the neighbouring State of Venezuela.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Two-fifths of Colombia is mountainous territory,
the plateaux and spurs of the Andes, between
which latter run the Magdalena and Cauca Rivers.
The roads are mule-trails, such as bring again
and again before us as we experience their discomforts
the fact that Colombia, in common with
all the Andine Republics, is still in the Middle
Ages as far as means of rural transport are concerned.
Yet the landscape is often of the most
delightful, and the traveller, in the intervals of
expending his breath in cursing the trails, will
raise his eyes in admiration of the work of Nature
here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Especially is this the case when, in the dry
season, travel is less onerous and when nothing
can be more pleasing than the varying scenery.
Here "dipping down into a delightful little valley,
formed by a sparkling rivulet whose banks are
edged with cane, bamboo and tropical trees, inter-wreathed
with twining vines; there, circling a
mountain-side and looking across at a vast amphitheatre
where the striking vegetation, in wild <span id="Fix_20">profusion</span>,
is the gigantic wax-palm, that towers
sometimes to a height of 100 feet; then,
reaching the level of the oak and other
trees of the temperate zone, or still higher
at an altitude of 10,000 or 11,000 feet, the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">paramos</i>, bare of all vegetation save low shrubs,
which might be desolate were it not for the magnificent
mountain scenery, with the occasional view
of the glorious snow-peaks of the Central
Cordillera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"At times the road is poor: now and then,
cut into the solid rock of the mountain-side, towering
sheer hundreds of feet above you, while a
precipice yawns threateningly on the other side, it
may narrow down to a scant yard or two in width;
it may, for a short distance, climb at an angle
of almost forty-five degrees, with the roughest
cobble paving for security against the mules
slipping; or in a stretch of alluvial soil, the
ruts worn by the constant tread of the animals in
the same spot have worn deep narrow trenches,
characteristic of Andean roads, against the sides
of which one's knees will knock roughly if constant
vigilance be not exercised; worse yet, these
trenches will not be continuous, but will be interrupted
by mounds over which the mules have
continually stepped, sinking the road-bed deeper
and deeper by the iterated stamping of their hoofs
in the same hollow, till deep excavations are
formed, which in the rainy season are pools filled
with the most appalling mud. Such is a fair
picture applicable to many a stretch of so-called
road in Colombia.</p>

<p>"The 'hotel accommodations' on the way are
poor, of course; one stops at the usual shanty
and takes such fare as one can get, a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sancocho</i> or
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">arepas</i>, eked out with the foods prudentially
brought along. It is in such passes as the Quindio,
too, when one reaches the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">paramos</i>, thousands of
feet in altitude, and far above the clouds, that
one experiences the rigorous <em>cold</em> of the Tropics.
The temperature at night is nearly always below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
forty degrees; occasionally it drops to freezing-point,
and one feels it all the more after a sojourn
in the hot lowlands. No amount of clothing then
seems adequate. Travellers will remember the
bitter cold nights they have passed in the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">paramos</i>."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>This bitter atmosphere is experienced, let us
remember, on or near the Equator. But we are
led on to the beautiful Cauca Valley perhaps,
whence, if we wish, we may continue on through
the pretty town of Cali, and up over the tablelands
of Popayan and Pasto, and, passing the frontier,
so ride on to Quito, the capital of Ecuador&mdash;a
journey which will leave us with sensations both
painful and pleasurable.</p>

<p>"If you cannot withstand the petty discomforts
of the trail for the sake of the ever-shifting panorama
of snow-peaks, rugged mountains, cosy
valleys, smiling woodlands, trim little valleys, then
you are not worthy to be exhilarated by the sun-kissed
winds of the Andes, or soothed by the languorous
tropical moonlight of the lower lands, or
to partake of the open-handed hospitality which
will greet you.</p>

<p>"Such is the fame of the Cauca Valley that it
was long known throughout Colombia simply as
<em>the</em> valley, and that is now its legal name. It
is the valley <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">par excellence</i>. The name is used
to designate especially that stretch, about 15 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
25 miles wide and 150 miles long, where the
Cauca River has formed a gently sloping plain, at
an altitude of 3,000 to 3,500 feet above sea-level,
between the Central and the Western Cordilleras.
A little north of Cartago and a little south of La
Bolsa, the two ranges hem it in. The Cauca is
one of the real garden spots of the world. No
pen can describe the beauty of the broad smiling
valley, as seen from favourable points on either
range, with its broad green pastures, yellow fields
of sugar-cane, dark woodlands, its towns nestling
at the foothills, the Cauca River in the midst,
silvered by the reflected sun, and looking across
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">lomas</i> of the rapidly ascending foothills, with
cameo-cut country houses, topped by the dense
forests of the upper reaches of the mountains,
rising to majestic heights. From some places in
the western range will be seen the snow-clad Huila
in icy contrast to the blazing sun shining on the
luxuriant tropic vegetation beneath.</p>

<p>"The best developed parts of the hot and temperate
zones of Cundinamarca are along the
Magdalena Valley and the routes of the Girardot
Railway, the road to Cambao and the Honda trail.
In the warmer zone there are good sugar plantations:
in the temperate zone is grown the coffee
so favourably known in the markets of the world
under the name of Bogota: it attains its perfection
at an altitude of about 5,000 feet, and nowhere
else in Colombia has such careful attention been
given to its cultivation. The Sabana itself, by
which name the plateau of Bogota is known, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
all taken up with farms and towns&mdash;there is
scarcely a foot of undeveloped land. The climate
is admirably adapted to the European-blooded
animals, and the gentleman-farmer of Bogota takes
great pride in his stock. The finest cattle in
Colombia, a great many of imported Durham and
Hereford stock, and excellent horses of English
and Norman descent are bred here. This is the
only section in Colombia, too, where dairying on
any extensive scale is carried on, and where the
general level of agriculture has risen above the
primitive. The lands not devoted to pasture are
utilized chiefly for wheat, barley and potatoes.</p>

<p>"To offset bad water, the food supply is excellent,
and of wonderful variety. That is one of
the beauties of the climate of the Sabana. One
gets all northern fruits and flowers, blooming the
year round, and vegetables as well as quite a
few of the tropical ones. It is an interesting
sight to see tropical palms growing side by side
with handsome northern trees, like oaks and firs.
Some of the Sabana roads are lined with blackberries,
and one gets delicious little wild strawberries;
apples, pears and peaches are grown,
though usually of a poor quality, not properly
cultivated. Even oranges can grow on the Sabana,
and from the nearby hot country they send up
all manner of tropical fruits and vegetables. Then
there is no dearth of good cooks: the epicure
can enjoy private dinners and public banquets
equal to any in the world. The one lady who
reads this book will be interested to know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the servant problem is reduced to a minimum in
Bogota; good domestics are plentiful and cheap&mdash;five
to ten dollars a month is high pay. In the
houses of the well-to-do the servants are well
treated and lead happy lives; they have ample
quarters of their own, centring around their own
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>; and enough of the old patriarchal regime
survives to make them really a part of the
family."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Descending from the mountainous part of the
country, we reach, to the east, that portion of
Colombia situated upon the affluents of the
Orinoco, a region which we may more readily
consider in our description of that great river,
lying mainly in the adjoining Republic of
Venezuela. Here stretch the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llanos</i>, or plains, and
the forests which are the home of the wilder tribes,
for Colombia has various grades of civilization
among her folk, of which the last are these
aboriginals, and the middle the patient Christianized
Indians, who constitute the bulk of the working
classes. These last have the characteristics, with
small differences, of the Indian of the Cordillera
in general, of whom I have elsewhere ventured
upon some study.</p>

<p>In Colombia, although in some respects the
Republic is pervaded by a truly democratic spirit
as between class and class, power and privilege,
land and education are in the hands of a small
upper class. This condition does not make for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
social progress, and in the future may seriously
jeopardize the position of that class. Wisdom here,
as elsewhere in Spanish America, would advise
a broader outlook. Political misrule in the past
has been rampant, although revolutions of late
years have been infrequent.</p>

<p>There are innumerable matters in Colombia
which the observant traveller will find of the utmost
interest, but upon which we cannot dwell here. Our
way lies back to the Spanish Main, whence we
take steamer along the coast to the seaports of
Venezuela.</p>

<p>Colombia is in a unique geographical position
upon the South American Continent, in that it
is the only State with an Atlantic and Pacific coast;
added to which is the hydrographic condition
which gives the country an outlet also to the fluvial
system of the Amazon, by means of the great
affluents the Yapura and the Negro, as also the
Putumayo&mdash;if that stream is to be regarded in
Colombian territory, for the region is on the debatable
ground claimed by three countries,
Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.</p>

<p>Indeed, this portion of South America, one of
the wildest parts of the earth's surface, is of
great hydrographic interest, and looking at the
map, we see how these navigable streams bend
north, east and south, with the peculiar link of the
Casiquiare "Canal" or river, uniting the fluvial
systems of the Orinoco and the Amazon. (It is&mdash;but
on a vaster scale&mdash;as if a natural waterway
existed between the Thames and the Severn, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence.) This
"Canal" lies but 150 miles from the Equator,
a few miles from the border of Colombia, in
Venezuela. Beyond, to the north-east, is Guiana,
the land of Raleigh's El Dorado. Doubtless this
region, in the future&mdash;far-off it may be&mdash;will
become of much importance, and what is now
savage woodland and danger-haunted waterways
may some day be teeming with life and
activity.</p>

<p>The conditions as regards navigability are, of
course, relative in many instances here. Again,
the region is not necessarily altogether an uninhabited
one, for the rubber-stations have been
increasing rapidly of late years.</p>

<p>A somewhat forbidding coast presents itself as
our steamer, casting anchor, comes to rest in the
waters of La Guayra, the principal seaport of
Venezuela.</p>

<p>Here a bold rocky wall, apparently arising
sheer from the sea, a granite escarpment more
than a mile high, cuts off all view of the interior,
and, reflecting the heat of the tropic sun, makes
of the small and somewhat unprepossessing town
at its base one of the hottest seaports on the face
of the globe, as it was formerly one of the most
dangerous from the exposure of its roadstead.</p>

<p>But, as if in some natural compensation, there
lies beyond this rocky, maritime wall one of the
most beautiful capital cities of South America&mdash;Caracas,
reached by yonder railway, strung along
the face of the precipice, and affording from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
train a magnificent panorama of the seaport and
the blue Caribbean.</p>

<p>La Guayra, ranged like an amphitheatre around
the indentations in the precipice in which it
lies, with its tiers of ill-paved streets, has nevertheless
some good business houses, and the
Republic expended a million pounds sterling upon
its harbour works, executed and controlled by a
British company.</p>

<p>Looking seaward from its quay walls, we may
recall the doings of the old buccaneers of the
Spanish Main, and of other filibusters, who from
time to time have sacked the place since its founding
in the sixteenth century. Upon these quays
are filled bags of cocoa and coffee, and mountains
of hides, brought down from the interior, and other
products from plain and field and forest of the
hinterland, for La Guayra monopolizes, for State
reasons, much of the trade that might more naturally
find outlet through other seaports.</p>

<p>The little railway which bears us up and beyond
to Caracas winds, to gain elevation and passage,
for twenty-four miles, in order to cover a distance
in an air-line between the port and the
capital of about six. We find ourselves set down
in what enthusiastic descriptions of this particular
zone love to term a region of perpetual spring;
and indeed, at its elevation of 3,000 feet, the city
is alike free from the sweltering heat of the coast
and from the cold of the higher mountainous districts
beyond.</p>

<p>A handsome plaza confronts us, with an equestrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
statue of Bolivar. The plaza is mosaic-paved,
electrically lighted, shaded by trees and, in
the evening and on Sunday, the military bands
entertain the people after the customary Spanish
American method. Some showy public buildings,
and a museum with some famous paintings are
here; there are pleasing suburbs, luxurious
gardens and well laid-out streets, and this high
capital takes not unjustifiable pride to itself for its
beauty and artistic environment and atmosphere&mdash;conditions
which deserve a wider fame.</p>

<p>When we leave the Venezuelan capital and
travel over the wide territory of the Republic, we
find it is one of the most sparsely populated of
the Spanish American nations. Conditions in
internal development and social life are very much
like those of Colombia, with highlands and lowlands,
river and forest, cultivated plain and smiling
valley, malarial districts and dreary uplands. We
find the rudest Indian villages and the most
pleasing towns: the most ignorant and backward
Indian folk, the more docile and industrious
Christianized labouring class, and the highly educated,
sensitive and oligarchical upper class.</p>

<p>Again, we find the same variety of climate,
products and the gifts of Nature in general. We
see great plantations of coffee, especially in that
fertile region of Maracaibo, which Colombia in
part enjoys, and which gives its name to the
superior berry there produced for export. We see
broad estates, in their thousands, devoted to the
production of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cacao</i>, or chocolate, and similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
areas over which waves the succulent and vivid
green sugar-cane, whereon sugar is produced often
by old-fashioned methods. These products yield
returns so excellent that the growing of cotton, on
the vast lands suitable thereto, are in large degree
neglected, and must be regarded as an asset for
the future, whenever local labour may become
better organized or more plentiful.</p>

<p>Agriculture in this varied Republic, as in its
neighbour, Colombia, has been kept backward
by the same lack of labour, largely a punishment
for the decimation of the labouring folk in the civil
and other wars that have so often laid waste both
man and land.</p>

<p>Maracaibo, lake and district, of which we have
made mention, is in some respects a curious
region. Let us look at the map. We remark a
great indent on the coast of the Spanish Main.
It is the Gulf of Venezuela, continuing far inland
to what is termed Lake Maracaibo. The
gulf is partly closed by the curious Goajira
Peninsula.</p>

<p>From the appearance of the dwellings of the
Indian on this lake-shore, the name of Venezuela,
or "Little Venice," was given to the mainland
here; the lake-dwellings are built on piles driven
into the water. When the first Spaniards visited
the coast, under Alonzo de Ojeada&mdash;on board
with him was Amerigo Vespucci, the Florentine
who gave his name to America&mdash;they were struck
by the curious appearance of the Indian settlements,
and from so accidental a circumstance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the region baptized. The same type of dwelling
still characterizes the lake, and were it not for
the busy and important town of Maracaibo, the
traveller might almost fancy himself back in the
sixteenth century, coasting with the early explorers.</p>

<p>Indeed, as far as the Indians of the peninsula
are concerned, we might still be in these early
times, for these sturdy descendants of the Caribs,
whom the Spaniards came to dread, have maintained
their independence to this day, and although
they trade with the white folk, resist all attempts
at governmental control. This is a curious circumstance
upon the coast, which was the first part
of South America to be discovered, although it
might be conceivable in the far interior&mdash;especially
in view of the proximity of the busy and populous
city on the lake, a port of greater importance
than La Guayra in some respects, full of modern
life and trade. Maracaibo was at one time one
of the principal educational centres of South
America. Unfortunately the bar at the mouth of
the harbour unfits the place for the entry of large
vessels.</p>

<p>In this district lie the important petroleum fields,
which have been made the seat of recent enterprise
for the production of that coveted oil of
commerce.</p>

<span class="headersmallfont">VENEZUELA AND GUIANA</span></h2>

<p>If, as we have said, the approach to the Republic
of Venezuela at La Guayra seems forbidding and
inaccessible, it must not be inferred that this is
an inevitable characteristic of the coast. The
Caribbean Hills are splendid in their aspect from
the sea. They are forbidding in their grandeur.
The mighty ramparts rise almost sheer from the
ocean for thousands of feet, with cloud-veils flung
across them at times, and if, from the steamer's
deck, we may wonder how access to the hinterland
can be gained, we shall find that Nature has
furnished her passes, and some of the early
English adventurers of the Spanish Main scaled
these, as we may read in the stirring pages of
Hakluyt.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Personally, I retain strong impressions
of these cool-appearing, towering ramparts of
Nature seen whilst sweltering in the tropic heat
on shipboard.</p>

<p>Moreover, the great spurs of the Andes die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
out into the sea as we go east, and so Nature
has broken down the rampart, giving vent to her
marvellous hydrographic forces, which here
triumph over the orographic, in the Gulf of Paria
and the delta of the Orinoco, clothed with the
densest of tropical vegetation, the home of wild
beast and wild man, as shortly we shall observe.</p>

<p>There are further memories of British activity
in regard to Venezuelan seaports, more modern, less
picturesque than those we have already remarked.
For, in the year 1903, the loans and arrears upon
interest, the defaulted payments and disputed interpretations
of contracts, in railway construction and
other matters, and alleged arbitrary behaviour on
the part of Venezuelan Government officials, came
to a head, with the result that Great Britain, Germany
and Italy sent a combined fleet to blockade
the seaports, and an enforced settlement of the
creditors' claims was brought about.</p>

<p>However, these unfortunate incidents are of the
past. Venezuela has shown a desire for more
cordial relations with the outside world. Lately
she sent a representative to London with the purpose
of inaugurating closer commercial relations
with Britain.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>We have now to explore the great river of
Venezuela, the famous Orinoco.</p>

<p>The Orinoco, which pours its huge volume of
water into the Atlantic on the northern shore of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the continent, through a vast delta of over thirty
mouths, a volume derived from over four hundred
tributaries which descend from the spurs of the
Andes or from the wild and mysterious forests
of Guiana, flows through what might be one of
the richest valleys of the earth's surface, and
doubtless in the future may so become. But, like
the valley of the Amazon, its resources are comparatively
little utilized at present. Devastating
floods, malarious forests, ferocious crocodiles are
some of the elements the traveller encounters on
the higher waters of this great stream, notwithstanding
that Columbus wrote to his Spanish
sovereign that he had "found one of the rivers
flowing from the Earthly Paradise."</p>

<p>Unfortunately it may be said that the Spaniard
and his descendants have wrought destruction
rather than benefit here, and the population of the
valley is less now than it was four centuries ago.</p>

<p>We may ascend the Orinoco, in the stern-wheel
steamers which ply thereon, for about four hundred
miles to Ciudad Bolivar, which town forms the
chief and indeed almost the only trade centre,
and in the rainy season, when the river is high,
which is generally from June to November, by
smaller craft up the lengthy affluents. Such are
the Apure, the Meta, the Arauca and the Guaviare,
many hundreds of miles in length, rising far
away to the west amid the Cordillera, the cold
eastern slopes of whose lofty summits condense
and pour down torrents of water into an extraordinary
network of rivers which flow across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
plains of Colombia and Venezuela, flooding enormous
areas of land in their passage to the main
stream. Boats and barges may reach the Andes,
whose beautiful landscape forms the water-parting
of this remarkable fluvial system.</p>

</div>

<p>In the dry season snags and sandbanks render
navigation almost impossible on many of these
tributaries, and in some cases in the remote districts
the hordes of savages who dwell on the
banks add to the dangers of the voyager. There
are miles of rapids on certain of the waterways,
and great cataracts, whilst the forest comes down
to the water's edge, forming an impenetrable screen
of tropical vegetation, in which the traveller who
strays from his way is lost. This jungle is flooded
in the rainy season, the waters driving back all
animal life to the higher ground.</p>

<p>From the east comes the great Ventuari affluent,
with its unexplored head-waters in Guiana.</p>

<p>The Orinoco River is of much interest, whether
to the traveller or the hydrographer, and doubtless
some day its potentialities will be more greatly
utilized. In some respects this fluvial system
would lend itself to the improvements of the
engineer, and might perform for the region which
it waters services such as the Nile renders for
Egypt, instead of being, as it is, largely a destructive
agent. The general slope of the river is comparatively
slight, and thus canalization and
consequent improvement in navigation might be
carried out. Nearly a thousand miles from the
mouth the waters of one of the principal affluents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
are little above sea-level, but the rise and fall of
the flood is sometimes as much as fifty feet, and
confluences two miles wide in the dry season
are increased three or four times during the
rains.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features of these
rivers, as already remarked, is found in the
singular natural canal connecting the Orinoco with
the Amazon&mdash;the waterway of the Casiquiare
Canal,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which cuts across the water-parting of the
two hydrographic systems. Here the adventurous
canoe voyager may descend from the Orinoco and
reach the Rio Negro, falling into the Amazon near
Manaos.</p>

<p>The endless waterways of the upper reaches of
the Orinoco share often that silent, deserted
character which we shall remark upon the
Amazon tributaries, and which indeed, is common
to tropical streams often. Bird and animal life
seems all to have concealed itself. Even the
loathly alligator is not to be seen, nor the turtle,
nor other creature of the waters. Occasionally,
however, a scarlet ibis appears to break the
monotony, or an eagle or heron. For mile upon
mile, league upon league, there may be no opening
in the green wall of the dismal forest, until, suddenly,
as we pass, the wall gives way, a small
clearing is seen, with perhaps a Carib Indian hut,
dilapidated and solitary, whose miserable occupant,
hastily entering his canoe, shoots out from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
bank with some meagre objects of sale or barter in
the form of provisions or other.</p>

<p>Such, however, is not always the nature of these
rivers. The scene changes: there are sandy
shores and bayous, beautiful forest flowers and
gorgeous insect life, the chatter of the monkeys
and the forms of the characteristic tropical fauna.
Rippling streams flow from inviting woodland
glades untrodden by man, and high cascades send
their showers of sparkling drops amid the foliage
and over the fortress-like rocks around. Wafted
along by sail or paddle, guided by the expert
Indian boatmen, the craft weathers all dangers,
and the passenger sees pass before him a panorama
of the wilds whose impression will always
remain upon his mind. Thus the charm of exploration
never fails, and, borne upon the bosom
of some half-unknown stream, the traveller's cup
of adventure may on the Orinoco be filled to the
brim.</p>

<p>For many hundreds of miles these western
tributaries of the Orinoco flow through the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llanos</i>,
as the plains of this part of South America&mdash;in
Colombia and Venezuela&mdash;are termed, whose
characteristic flatness we shall remark from the
deck of the vessel. A sea of grass stretches away
to the horizon on every side, giving place in some
districts to forest.</p>

<p>The level plains, lying generally about four
hundred feet above the sea, were once the home
of enormous herds of cattle and horses and of a
hardy, intrepid race of folk known as the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llaneros</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
men who kept and tended the cattle and were
expert in horsemanship and woodcraft. These folk
flourished best in the Colonial period. They
formed some of the best fighting material in South
America, and made their mark in the War of Independence,
when, under Bolivar, the Spanish yoke
was thrown off. Again, civil war, revolution and
hardships and losses consequent thereon seriously
reduced their numbers, and to-day both they and
their herds have almost disappeared.</p>

<p>The great plains which were the scene of these
former activities might, under better auspices,
become an important source of food supply, both
for home and foreign needs. They could again
support vast herds of cattle on their grassy
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">campos</i>, irrigated by the overflow of the Orinoco.
This overflow, it is true, causes extensive lagoons
to form, known locally as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">esteros</i> or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cienagas</i>, but
these dry up in great part after the floods, which
have meantime refreshed the soil and herbage.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The great green or brown plain of the Llanos
is often beautified by small golden, white and pink
flowers, and sedges and irises make up much of
the small vegetation. Here and there the beautiful
'royal' palm, with its banded stem and graceful
crown, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">moriche</i>, or one of the other kinds,
forms clumps to break the monotony, and along
the small streams are patches of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chaparro</i> bushes,
cashew-nuts, locusts and so forth. The banks of
the rivers often support denser groves of ceibas,
crotons, guamos, etc.; the last-named bears a pod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
covered with short, velvety hair, within which,
around the beans (about the size of our broad
beans), is a cool, juicy, very refreshing pulp, not
unlike that of the young cocoa-pod. Along the
banks of the streams in front of the trees are
masses of reeds and semi-aquatic grasses, which
effectually conceal the higher vegetation from a
traveller in a canoe at water-level."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Much stress has been laid upon the possible
economic value of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llanos</i> by some writers,
whilst others regard these possibilities as exaggerated.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Their area is calculated at 100,000
square miles. They are neither prairies nor desert.
During a large part of the year they are subject
to heavy rainfall and become swamped, followed
by a drought so intense that the streams dry up
and the parched grass affords no pasture for stock.
There is a total lack of roads, and the rivers are
unbridged, and the region is far from the ocean.
The trade wind blows fiercely across them.</p>

<p>The view over these vast plains as the
traveller's eyes suddenly rest upon them as he
descends the Andes is very striking, and has
been described by various observers, among them
Humboldt.</p>

<p>In the wet season, when the river overflows, the
cattle are driven back to higher ground. When
the waters retire alligators and water snakes bury
themselves in the mud to pass the dry season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>In this connexion stories are told of travellers
and others who, having camped for the night in
some hut or chosen spot, are suddenly awakened
by the upheaval of the ground beneath them and
the emergence of some dreadful monster therefrom.
A certain traveller's experience in the
night was that of being awakened by the barking
of his dogs, the noise of which had roused a huge
alligator, which heaved up the floor of the hut,
attacked the dogs and then made off.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>As for the old type <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llanero</i>, half Spanish, half
Indian, the wild, brave, restless, devil-may-care
cowboy, a Cossack of the Colombian Steppes and
a boastful Tartarin full of poetic fire rolled into
one, is rapidly disappearing. Vanished is the
poetry and romance of his life, if it ever really
existed outside of his remarkable <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cantos</i>, wherein
heroic exploits as soldier, as hunter and as gallant
lover are recounted with a superb hyperbole. He
seems to have tamed down completely, in spite
of the solitary, open-air life, and in spite of the
continuance of a certain element of danger,
battling with the elements. Encounters with
jaguars, reptiles, savage Indians are, however, the
rarest of episodes in the life of even the most
daring and exposed <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llanero</i>.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>A "picturesque" character of original <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llanero</i>
stamp was the notorious President Castro of
Venezuela, who defied the whole world at one time,
and almost succeeded in bringing about a conflict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
between England and the United States over
the Guiana-Venezuela boundary.</p>

<p>The wild tribes of Venezuela, and part of British
Guiana, are typified in those inhabiting the delta
of the Orinoco. They have preserved their racial
character in marked degree here, and have been
regarded as an offshoot of the Caribs.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They are dark copper in colour, well set up,
and strong, though not as a rule tall, and with low
foreheads, long and fine black hair, and the usual
high cheek-bones and wide nostrils of the South
American 'Indians.' Where they have not come
into contact with civilization they are particularly
shy and reticent, but they soon lose this character,
and some are said to show considerable aptitude
as workmen.</p>

<p>"Living as they do mainly in the delta, their
houses are of necessity near water, and are raised
from the ground as a protection against floods,
being sometimes, it is said, even placed on platforms
in trees. The roof is supported in the
middle by two vertical posts and a ridge pole, and
is composed of palm-leaves, supported at the
corners by stakes. The sides of this simple
hut consist of light palm-leaf curtains, and
the floor is of palm-planks. The hammocks are
slung on the ridge pole, and the bows and arrows
of the occupants fixed in the roof, while their
household furniture, consisting of home-made
earthenware pots, calabashes of various sizes, etc.,
lie promiscuously about the floor. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Warraus are nomadic, and live in canoes, but the
majority are grouped in villages of these huts,
with captains responsible to the Venezuelan local
government authorities.</p>

<p>"The staple diet of these people is manioc and
sago, with <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chicha</i> (a mixture of manioc meal and
water). For clothing they dispense with everything
in their homes, except the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">buja</i> or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">guayuco</i>,
a tiny apron of palm-fibre or ordinary cloth, held
in position by a belt of palm-fibre or hair. That
worn by women is triangular, and often ornamented
with feathers or pearls. Among the whites
the men always wear a long strip of blue cloth,
one end of which passes round the waist, the other
over the shoulder, hanging down in front; the
women have a kind of long sleeveless gown. For
ornament they wear necklaces of pearls, or more
frequently of red, blue and white beads, and tight
bracelets and bangles of hair or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">curagua</i> (palm-fibre);
some pierce ears, nose and lower lips for
the insertion of pieces of reed, feathers or berries
on fête days. The characteristic dull red paint
on their bodies is intended to act as a preventive
against mosquitoes, and it is made by boiling the
powdered bark and wood of a creeper in turtle or
alligator fat. All hair is removed from the body
by the simple but painful process of pulling each
one out with a split reed.</p>

<p>"Marriage, as is usual among savage races,
takes place at a very early age, the husband being
often only fourteen, the wife ten or twelve years
of age. Polygamy is common, but not universal;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
where a chief or rich man has several wives, the
first, or the earliest to become a mother, takes
charge of the establishment during the absence
of the owner on his hunting or fishing expeditions.
The girls are sometimes betrothed at the age of
five or six years, living in the house of the future
husband from that time on.</p>

<p>"At birth the mother is left in a separate house
alone, where all food that she may need is placed
for her, though she remains unvisited by any of
her companions throughout the day; meanwhile
the father remains in his hammock for several
days, apparently owing to a belief that some evil
may befall the child; there he receives the congratulations
of the villagers, who bring him
presents of the best game caught on their expeditions.
This male child-bed, or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">couvade</i>, is common
to many of the Indian tribes.</p>

<p>"The dead are mourned with elaborate ceremony&mdash;shouting,
weeping and slow, monotonous
music; the nearest relatives of the defunct cut
their hair. The body is placed in leaves and tied
up in the hammock used by the owner during life,
and then placed in a hollow tree-trunk or in his
canoe. This rude coffin is then generally placed
on a small support, consisting of bamboo trestles,
and so left in the deserted house of the dead
man."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The wild animal life of this part of South
America has always been of interest, whether to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the scientist or the general reader. It is varied,
as it is in Mexico and elsewhere in Spanish
America, by the natural topographical and climatic
divisions of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tierra caliente</i>, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tierra templada</i> and
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tierra fria</i>, or hot, temperate and cold lands
respectively.</p>

<p>The various kinds of monkeys include the
spider-monkeys, the squirrel-monkeys, the marmosets,
the vampires, the jaguar and puma&mdash;the
former of which has been credited with living in the
high branches of the trees in flood-times, to the perturbation
of the monkeys, upon whose home it
intrudes, chasing them to the tree-tops. In the
Andes the peculiar "Speckled bear" has its
abode. The manati is a native of the Orinoco,
and the sloth of its forests, as also the "Ant-bear"
and armadillo.</p>

<p>These creatures may not always be readily seen
by the passing traveller, but the birds are more
present, although, as elsewhere in the Tropics, their
plumage is more noteworthy than their song.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Beautifully coloured jays, the peculiar cassiques,
with their hanging nests, starlings, and the
many violet, scarlet and other tanagers, with some
very pretty members of the finch tribe, are all
fairly abundant in Venezuela. Greenlets, some of
the allied waxwings, and thrushes of various kinds,
with the equally familiar wrens, are particularly
abundant, nor does the cosmopolitan swallow
absent himself from this part of the world. The
numerous family of the American flycatchers has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
fifty representatives in Venezuela, and the allied
ant-birds constitute one of the exceptions to the
rule, in possessing a pleasant warbling note. The
chatterers include some of the most notable birds
of Venezuela, and we may specially notice the
strange-looking umbrella-bird which extends into
the Amazon territory, known from its note as the
fife-bird; the variegated bell-bird, which makes
a noise like the ringing of a bell; the gay
manikins, whose colours include blue, crimson,
orange and yellow, mingled with sober blacks,
browns and greens; the nearly allied <span id="Fix_45">cock-of-the-rock</span>
is one of the most beautiful birds of
Guayana, orange-red being the principal colour
in its plumage, while its helmet-like crest adds to
its grandeur; the hen is a uniform reddish-brown.
The wood-hewers are more of interest from their
habits than the beauty of their plumage.</p>

<p>"The beautiful green jacamars, the puff-birds,
and the bright-coloured woodpeckers are found all
over Venezuela in the forests, but their relatives
the toucans are among the most peculiar of the
feathered tribe. With their enormous beaks and
gaudy plumage they are easily recognized when
seen, and can make a terrible din if a number
of them collected together are disturbed, the individual
cry being short and unmelodious. Several
cuckoos are found in Venezuela, some having
more or less dull plumage and being rare, while
others with brighter feathers are gregarious. With
the trogons, however, we come to the near relatives
of the beautiful quezal, all medium-sized birds, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the characteristic metallic blue or green back and
yellow or red breasts. The tiny, though equally
beautiful, humming-birds are common sights in the
forest, but a sharp eye is needed to detect them
in their rapid flight through the dim light; some
of the Venezuelan forms are large, however,
notably the king humming-bird of Guayana; and
the crested coquettes, though smaller, are still large
enough to make their golden-green plumage conspicuous.
The birds which perhaps most force
themselves, not by sight but by sound, upon the
notice of travellers are the night-jars; the 'who
are you?' is as well known in Trinidad as in
Venezuela. The great wood night-jar of Guayana
has a very peculiar mournful cry, particularly uncanny
when heard in the moonlight. The king-fisher-like
motmots have one representative in
Venezuela, but the other member of the group,
which includes all the preceding birds, constitute a
family by itself. This is the oil-bird, or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">guacharo</i>,
famous from Humboldt's description of the cave
of Caripe in which they were first found. The
young birds are covered with thick masses of
yellow fat, for which they are killed in large
numbers by the local peasantry. They live in
caves wherever they are found, and only come out
to feed at dusk.</p>

<p>"Other birds which are sure to be observed
even by the least ornithological traveller are the
parrots and macaws, which fly in flocks from tree
to tree of the forest, uttering their discordant cries.
The macaws have blue and red or yellow plumage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
but the parrots and parraquets are all wholly or
mainly of a green hue. The several owls are
naturally seldom seen, and, in the author's experience,
rarely heard.</p>

<p>"There are no less than thirty-two species of
falcons or eagles known from Venezuela, and of
these many are particularly handsome, such as the
swallow-tailed kite and the harpy eagle of
Guayana. Their loathsome carrion-eating cousins,
the vultures, have four representatives.</p>

<p>"In the rivers and caños of the lowlands there
are abundant water-birds, and the identified species
include a darter, two pelicans, several herons or
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">garzas</i>, the indiscriminate slaughter of which in
the breeding season for egret plumes has been one
of the disgraces of Venezuela, as well as storks
and ibises. Among the most beautiful birds of
these districts are the rosy, white or scarlet flamingoes,
huge flocks of which are sometimes seen
rising from the water's edge at the approach of a
boat or canoe. There are also seven Venezuelan
species of duck.</p>

<p>"The various pigeons and doves possess no very
notable characteristics, and one or two of the
American quails are found in the Andes. Other
game-birds include the fine-crested curassows of
Guayana, the nearly allied guans and the pheasant-like
hoatzin. There are several rails, and the finfeet
are represented. The sun bittern is very
common on the Orinoco. There are members of
the following groups: the trumpeters (tamed in
Brazil to protect poultry), plovers, terns, petrels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
grebes, and, lastly, seven species of the flightless
tinamous.</p>

<p>"Descending lower in the scale, we come to the
animals which are, or used to be, most often
associated in the mind with the forests of South
America. The snakes are very numerous, but only
a minority are poisonous. Of the latter, the
beautiful but deadly coral-snake is not very
common, but a rattlesnake and the formidable
'bushmaster' are often seen. Of the non-poisonous
variety the water-loving boas and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tigres</i>
or anacondas are mainly confined to the delta and
the banks of the Guayana rivers. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cazadora</i>
(one of the colubers) and the Brazilian wood-snake
or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sipo</i>, with its beautiful coloration, are common;
the blind or velvet snake is often found in the
enclosures of dwellings.</p>

<p>"One of the lizards, the amphisbæna, is known
in the country as the double-headed snake, and is
popularly supposed to be poisonous, but there are
many species of the pretty and more typical forms,
especially in the dry regions, while the edible
iguana is common in the forests. There are eleven
species of crocodiles, of which the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caiman</i> infests
all the larger rivers and caños. The Chelonidæ
include only two land tortoises, but there are
several turtles in the seas and rivers, and representatives
of this family from the Gulf of Paria
often figure on the menus of City companies.</p>

<p>"There are some six genera of frogs and toads
to represent the Amphibians, and the evening
croaking of the various species of the former on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the Llanos is very characteristic of those regions;
one, in particular, emits a sound like a human
shout, and a number of them give the impression
of a crowd at a football match.</p>

<p>"Fish abound in rivers, lakes and seas, but, considering
their number, remarkably little is known
about them. Some are regarded as poisonous, and
others are certainly dangerous, such as the small
but ferocious <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caribe</i> of the Llano rivers, which is
particularly feared by bathers, as an attack from a
shoal results in numbers of severe, often fatal,
wounds. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">temblador</i>, or electric eel, is very
abundant in the western Llanos, and is as dangerous
in its way as the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caribe</i>.</p>

<p>"The insects are too numerous for more than
casual reference, but it may be noted that the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mosquito</i>
of the Spaniards is a small and very annoying
sandfly; the mosquito, as we know it, is, and
always has been, called <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">zancudo de noche</i> by the
Spanish-speaking inhabitants of Venezuela. The
gorgeous butterflies and the emerald lights of the
fireflies are in a measure a compensation for
the discomforts caused by their relatives, but of the
less attractive forms, the most interesting are the
hunting ants, which swarm through houses at times
devouring all refuse, and the parasol ants, which
make with the leaves they carry hot-beds, as it
were, for the fungus upon which they feed.</p>

<p>"One of the most unpleasant of the lower forms

spider of Guayana, which sometimes measures
more than six inches across; it is found in the remote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
parts of the forest, and its bites cause severe

dangerous, can inflict severe bites. The extremely

<p>The wild people and the wild life of northern
South America remind us again that the first discovered
part of the continent is in some respects
still the least known and most backward. The
"streams flowing from the Earthly Paradise" of
Columbus still traverse an Elysium for the adventurous
traveller.</p>

<p>The coast of the Spanish Main trends now
eastwards to the possession of Britain, in the
Guayanas, and the beautiful Island of Trinidad,
which we shall now enter upon.</p>

<p>Columbus, on his voyage in 1496, approaching
South America, beheld three peaks rising from
a beautiful island clothed with verdure. Uniting
the pious custom of his time with his impression
of the topography of the new land, he called the
island "Trinidad," or the Trinity. Spain held it.
Sir Walter Raleigh burned its capital, and finally
it fell to Britain at the beginning of the nineteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
century. To-day, this land off this wild coast,
under the flag of Britain, is a revelation to the
traveller, who&mdash;British or other&mdash;may have forgotten
its existence. Its capital, Port of Spain, is
one of the most pleasing towns in the West Indies,
with two cathedrals, shaded streets, tramways,
government institutions and public buildings,
libraries, shops, a beautiful botanical garden and
other evidences of a very modern civilization and
activity. The soil is rich, the climate good, the
hurricanes that from time to time devastate the
West Indies do not visit it. It lies almost in
the mouth of the river Orinoco. Venezuela claims
it as hers. I well recollect the aspect of
this foothold of Britain after the wilds of South
America. But its modernity does not detract from
the interest of the more ancient Spanish
American communities.</p>

<p>British Guiana, whose coast we soon approach,
and its neighbours, Dutch and French Guiana, are
ranged in sequence along the Atlantic front for
seven hundred miles, and present topographical
conditions curiously alike.</p>

<p>Guiana, as a geographical term, is that district
lying between the water-parting of the Orinoco
and the Amazon and the coast; and is almost
a topographical entity, embodying part of Venezuela.
It is, in a sense, an island, by reason of
the union of the Orinoco and Amazon fluvial
systems by the Casiquiare.</p>

<p>Students of Anglo-American relations will recollect
that the controversy over the boundary line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
between British and Venezuelan territory here
became the subject of contention&mdash;and almost of
war&mdash;between Great Britain and the United States
in 1895, by reason of the work of the wild President
Castro and the unwarranted behaviour of
President Cleveland of the United States&mdash;behaviour
which was greatly resented by English
people in South America and which has not yet
been forgotten. Happily arbitration was entered
upon&mdash;Britain practically being awarded what she
had justly claimed.</p>

<p>British Guiana is one of the neglected outposts
of the British Empire, the only foothold of
England on the mainland of South America, a
place of considerable interest, beauty and utility,
but about which the good folk of Great Britain
know and perhaps care little.</p>

<p>The British public cannot be expected to be
well acquainted with all the outlying parts of the
immense empire which fortune or providence has
delivered over to them, but, through their statesmen,
they could, if they were so minded, bring
about a much more constructive and energetic
policy than that which the inaccessible and old-fashioned
Colonial Office and Crown Colony
officials consider does duty for government and
development.</p>

<p>The population of this land is a handful of folk
of about the size of a second-rate English town,
notwithstanding that the extent of the country is
equal to the whole of Great Britain. Its rich
littoral is watered by large rivers, rising in a little-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
interior. Sugar is produced, but might be
produced in quantities to satisfy the British house-wife
did British folk know anything about the
subject. There are enormous timber resources
and valuable minerals.</p>

<p>But in such development comes the cry for
"labour." It is the first cry of all tropical possessions.
Where is labour to come from? The
remedy generally proposed is that of bringing in
coloured labour from other parts of the empire,
coolies and others. This policy has some fatal
defects. Among these the practice of bringing
in hordes of coloured men without their women
or families is one of the most unwise. It is unnatural
to condemn these folk to live without their
female partners, and if persisted in will, sooner or
later, bring serious evils upon the community that
practises it. The existing labour should be more
carefully fostered, and if labour be imported it
should be as far as possible in the form of permanent
settlers, with their wives and families, the
condition of whose life and surroundings should be
intelligently mapped out beforehand.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>Guiana brings back sad memories of Sir Walter
Raleigh, he who by reason of his antagonism to
Spain was a popular hero, and around whose figure
much romance has centred.</p>

<p>Partly with the object of recouping his fortune,
Raleigh sailed, in 1595, to Guiana, a voyage of
exploration and conquest, with the main object
of finding that El Dorado which was so strong
an obsession of Elizabethan times, imagined to
be hidden somewhere amid the Cordillera or
forests of Spanish America. His book, recounting
the incidents of this voyage, <cite>The Discoverie of
Guiana</cite>, which he published upon his return home,
is one of the most thrilling adventurous narratives
of the period, although it has been said that it
contains much that was romance rather than fact:
and incredulity marked its reception. On his
second expedition, after Elizabeth's death&mdash;an expedition
which was perhaps one of the saddest of
forlorn hopes, whereby Raleigh hoped, trusting
perhaps to a chapter of accidents, to escape from
the dreadful position of disfavour and threatened
execution into which he had fallen in the reign
of James I&mdash;he reached Trinidad and sailed up
the Orinoco, fell sick of a fever and suffered many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
disasters in the endeavour to carry out his undertaking
to find a vast gold mine upon territory not
belonging to Spain. Should he fail, or trespass
upon Spanish territory, he was to be executed as
a pirate, a fate which practically befell him, though
he was executed under his old sentence of
conspiracy.</p>

<p>The illustrious Raleigh&mdash;whose name some
writers love to belittle&mdash;"took a pipe of tobacco
a little before he went to the scaffold," for the
habit of smoking tobacco&mdash;that beautiful gift of
the Spanish American Indian to the Old World&mdash;had
become rooted among the Elizabethan
courtiers.</p>

<p>But to return to Guiana. The topography of
this part of South America is full of interest and
variety, as are the history and customs of its
people, aboriginal and other, although much of the
past is marked by dreadful happenings. Wars,
the deeds of buccaneers, rebellions of negroes,
massacre of the whites, deaths from fevers and so
forth stand out from its pages.</p>

<p>It is a magnificent country, with grand rivers,
cascades and the most wonderful mountains and
scenery, which it is difficult to surpass in any
part of South America. And here the traveller
and the naturalist may revel in the works of
Nature.</p>

<p>Guiana was the first part of the New World
to be explored by adventurers other than the
Spaniard and the Portuguese, and to this day it
stands out as foreign to the rest of Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
America. The English, the French, the Dutch
fought between themselves for its territory and
its colonizing and trading stations. The English
sought an El Dorado, the Dutchman thought of
its tobacco&mdash;which the Spaniards would not permit
him to obtain from their colonies&mdash;the Frenchman
took part possibly out of national pride,
thinking he ought not to be left out in the
partition, but his work seems to have been of a
disastrous nature ever since he set foot there. The
Pilgrim Fathers, before they "moored their bark
on a wild New England coast," had dreams of
settling here, where the warm climate and tropic
possibilities seemed to hold out greater allurements
than the cold coasts of the more northern continent.
When Surinam, or Dutch Guiana, was exchanged
for the New Netherlands and New
Amsterdam&mdash;to-day New York&mdash;few Dutchmen
dissented, and some English protested.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Like the valley of the Amazon, to which
system it may be considered an offshoot, it is a
land of forest and stream. The coast is generally
an alluvial flat, often below high-water mark,
fringed with courida (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Avicennia nitida</i>) on the seashore,
and mangrove (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhizophora manglier</i>) on
the banks of the tidal rivers. Where it is not
empoldered it is subject to the wash of the sea in
front and the rising of the swamp water behind.
In fact, it is a flooded country, as the name, from
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">wina</i> or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Guina</i> (water) seems to imply.</p>

<p>"The lowest land is the delta of the Orinoco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
where the rising of the river often covers the
whole. Coming to the north-west of British
Guiana, we have a number of channels (<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">itabos</i>)
forming natural waterways through swamps, navigable
for canoes and small vessels. A similar
series of natural canals is found in Dutch Guiana.
From the Orinoco to Cayenne this alluvium is
rarely above high-water mark, and is subject to
great changes from currents, the only protection
being the natural palisade of courida, with its
fascine-like roots. On the coast of Cayenne, however,
the land rises, and there are rocky islands;
here the swamps come at some distance behind
the shore, and between ridges and banks of
sand.</p>

<p>"Behind this low land comes the old beach of
some former age&mdash;reefs of white quartz sand, the
stunted vegetation of which can only <span id="Fix_57">exist</span> because
the rainfall is heavy and almost continuous. This
is the fringe of the great forest region which
extends over the greater part of the country. Here
the land rises and becomes hilly, and the rivers
are obstructed by a more or less continuous series
of rocks, which form rapids and prevent them
running dry when the floods recede. Behind
these, to the south, the hills gradually rise to
mountains of 5,000 feet, and in the case of a
peculiar group of sandstone castellated rocks, of
which Roraima is the highest, to 8,000 feet.</p>

<p>"The numerous rivers bring down vegetable
matter in solution, clay and fine sand suspended
and great masses of floating trees and grasses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
These form islands in the larger estuaries and bars
at the mouths of most of the rivers; they also
tinge the ocean for about fifty miles beyond
the coast from green to a dirty yellow. Wind and
wave break down the shore in one place and extend
it in another, giving a great deal of trouble to the
plantations by tearing away the dams which protect
their cultivation. Every large river has its
islands, which begin with sand-banks, and by
means of the courida and mangrove become ultimately
habitable. In the Essequebo there are
several of a large extent, on which formerly were
many sugar plantations, one of which remains in
Wakenaam. The Corentyne and Marowyne have
also fair-sized islands, but none of these has ever
been settled. Off the coast of Cayenne the rocky
Iles du Salut and Connetable are quite exceptional,
for the coast is elsewhere a low mud-flat,
sloping very gradually, and quite shallow.</p>

<p>"The longest river is the Essequebo, which rises
in the extreme south, and like most of the larger
streams, flows almost due north. It is about
600 miles in length; the Corentyne is nearly as
long, and the Marowyne and Oyapok are probably
about the same length. Other rivers that would
be considered of great importance in Europe are
seen at intervals of a few miles all along the
coast. The Demerara, on which the capital of
British Guiana is situated, is about the size of
the Thames, and 250 miles long, and the Surinam,
on the left bank of which is Paramaribo, 300.
All are blocked by rapids at various distances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
from 50 to about 100 miles inland, up to which
they are navigable for small vessels, but beyond,
only for properly constructed boats that can be
drawn through the falls or over portages.</p>

<p>"The smaller rivers, called creeks, whether they
fall into the sea or into the larger streams, are very
numerous; over a thousand have Indian names.
Many of them are of a fair size, and the majority
have dark water of the colour of weak coffee,
whence the name Rio Negro has been given to
several South American rivers. These take their
rise in the pegass swamps, so common everywhere,
and are tinged by the dead leaves of the dense
growth of sedges, which prevent these bodies of
water from appearing like lakes. There are, however,
a few deeper swamps, where a lake-like expanse
is seen in the centre, but no real lakes
appear to exist anywhere. The creeks are often
connected with each other by channels, called
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">itabos</i>, or, by the Venezuelans, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">canos</i>, through
which it is possible to pass for long distances without
going out to sea. During the rainy season
these channels are easily passable, and light canoes
can be pushed through from the head of one creek
to that of another, the result being that large tracts
of country are easily passed. In this way the Rio
Negro and Amazon can be reached from the Essequebo
in one direction and the Orinoco in another,
the watersheds being ill-defined from there being
no long mountain ranges.</p>

<p>"The higher hills and mountains are not
grouped in any order. The group called the Pakaraima<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
are the most important from their position
on the boundary between British Guiana, Venezuela
and Brazil, and also from the neighbourhood
of Roraima giving rise to streams which feed the
Orinoco, Amazon and Essequebo. This peculiar
clump of red sandstone rocks forms the most interesting
natural object in Guiana. Roraima is
the principal, but there are others, named
Kukenaam, Iwaikarima, Waiakapiapu, etc., almost
equally curious and striking. All have the appearance
of great stone castles, standing high above
the slopes, which are covered with rare and beautiful
plants, some of which are unknown elsewhere.
The main characteristics of this group are due
to weathering, the result being grotesque forms
that stand boldly forth, together with fairy dells,
waterfalls decorated with most delicate ferns and
mosses and grand clumps of orchids and other
flowering plants."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>It is not to be supposed that British Guiana
has been neglected by its modern administration.
A great deal has been done in draining, in reconstructing
the villages, in fostering agriculture, in
organizing the natives, in providing against malaria
and disease by scientific methods, such as at
Panama had been found so beneficial. The treatment
of immigrant labour is almost paternal in
some respects. Surinam is also progressing, stimulated
by the example of Demerara. Cayenne, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
French possession, suffers still from being a penal
settlement.</p>

<p>The life of the coloured folk, who so largely
predominate among the population, offers many
problems, whose solutions will doubtless work
themselves out. The people of Guiana are possibly
more varied than those of any other community
in the world, with representations of every race&mdash;the
European and Indo-European, the African
negro, the Chinese, folk from Java and Annam,
together with its own native races, and the white
American, with many mixed breeds.</p>

<p>In the views of the writer already quoted&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Among the other points of interest there is the
impress of the three nationalities upon the negro,
which are very conspicuous in the women. The
French negress is unlike her sister in Surinam,
and she differs also from the English type in
Demerara. Again, they all stand apart from the
real African and the bush negro, illustrating the
possibility of the perpetuation of acquired characters
and the manner in which tribal differences have
been developed. 'The French,' said an old writer,
'are a civil, quick and active sort of people, given
to talking, especially those of the female sex';
the Dutch have a more heavy look and wear their
clothes loose and baggy, cleanliness being more
conspicuous than a good fit; the English (including
specially the Barbardian) are decidedly careless
and slovenly, and inclined to ape the latest fashion.
A Frenchman speaks of the Demerara negress as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
dressing up in her mistress's old gowns and wanting
a style of her own; we have seen a cook going to
market in an old silk dress once trimmed with
lace, now smudged with soot and reeking with
grease. They all have a love for finery but no
taste in colour; here and there, however, a girl
with a pure white dress and embroidered head-kerchief
pleases the eye and proves that dress is
of some importance in our estimate of these people.</p>

<p>"The negro man has no peculiarity in his
clothes; he simply follows the European. His
working dress is generally the dirty and ragged
remains of what we may call his Sunday suit.
He may be clean otherwise, but his covering gives
us the contrary impression. There is a character
about the Demerara creole, but he is not so
English as the Barbadian, who is 'neither Carib
nor creole, but true Barbadian born.' Loyalty to
the Mother Country as well as to his own island
is very conspicuous; he has followed the white
man in this as well as in his language, which
retains some of the obsolete words and phrases
of the Stuart period, including the asseveration
'deed en fait' for 'in deed and in faith.' These
national characteristics go to prove that the negro
has been changed somewhat by environment, and
this can be easily seen when he is compared with
the African, who is represented here and there by
a few of the old people who were rescued from
slavers.</p>

<p>"The bush negro of Surinam, who ranges also
through Cayenne and into Brazilian territory, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
distinct type. Made up of a number of African
tribes, and probably dominated by the Coromantee,
the most independent of these, he has not been
much affected by his short service under the Dutch.
From a physical standpoint he is a fine fellow,
muscular and brawny; a good boatman and
warrior, he has held his own for two centuries.
Having first gained his freedom by his strong arm,
he fought to retain it; the result is a man that
must be respected. Possibly he learnt something
from the native Indian, but he has never been
very friendly, for the aborigines do not like the
negro. In Demerara, and to a less extent in
Surinam, Indians were formerly employed to hunt
runaway slaves, and this accounts for the ill-feeling.</p>

<p>"We may consider the bush negro as an African
savage, very slightly altered by the change from
the forests of the Congo to the wilds of Guiana.
Like African tribes, the communities have no bond
of union, but are each under its own granman,
or chief. This segregation has been the cause of
much trouble in the past, for a treaty might be
made with one chief which was by no means
binding on the others. Their huts are low and
confined, lacking any conveniences and without
order. Their few arts are of African types, and
their tribal marks coarse scars. Small clearings
are made near their dwellings in which ground
provisions enough to support their families are
raised, and sometimes a little rice to sell. They
also cut timber and bring it to Paramaribo for
sale, with the proceeds of which they buy finery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Latterly they have been found useful to carry gold-diggers
and balata-bleeders into the interior, for
they are well accustomed to navigate the rapids.
In Surinam the latest estimate of their number is
8,000; a few years ago they were put down as
about 25,000 in all Guiana. They do not appear
to increase to any extent; in fact, judging by the
number of runaways who have taken to the bush
in two centuries, the decrease from war and other
causes must have been enormous. Their sexual
relations, which are very loose, as among negroes
generally, do not consist with an increase, but at
the same time there is no doubt that we have here
a survival of the strongest. Whether these people
will ever mingle with other negroes is doubtful;
at present the bush negro despises the fellow with
a master or employer, and the black man of the
settled portion of the colony treats him as a savage.</p>

<p>"In British Guiana the runaways were hunted
by Indians; it followed, therefore, that no such
communities of wild men were possible. The river
people are largely of mixed African and Indian
blood, more often perhaps with more or less of
the European. They carry on the timber trade
and are prominent as boat hands. Formerly, every
family had its bateau or corial, but since steamers
have been plying up the rivers a craft is less
needed.</p>

</div>

<p>"The coloured people are of all shades. The
offspring of black and white is the mulatto, who
generally partakes equally of the character of both
races, but with variations. The man is coarser-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
than the woman, but as a rule he is strong
and healthy; if, however, he marries a woman of
his own colour the offspring are in many cases
weaker than the parents. A cob is a reversion
towards the negro, the child of one black parent
with a mulatto, three-quarters black and hardly
distinguishable. The mustee or quadroon, who is
three-fourths white, and the costee or octoroon may
be considered as practically white and in many
cases can only be distinguished as coloured by
those who know their parentage. In Guiana colour
prejudice is most conspicuous among these lighter
people, for they want to marry a 'higher' colour
than themselves, and are considered as degrading
the family when demeaning it by coming down
towards the negro. A black woman will think
more of her illegitimate mulatto children than of
those she has borne to her negro husband. The
ideal of the pure negro is the bucra&mdash;<span id="Fix_65">the</span> well-to-do
European; poor whites or coloured people are in
his opinion unworthy of respect. He rarely gets
on well as servant to one of his own colour;
quarrels and fights are common among workmen
where they are under men of their own class. The
negro also despises the Chinaman and East Indian,
who in turn prefer to have few dealings with them.
The general result is that there are not many
sexual unions between the races. Now and again
a respectable black man, doctor or lawyer, marries
a white woman, but such unions generally bring
trouble. The tendency now is for the darker
coloured people to merge themselves in the black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and the lighter in the white; the probable result
will ultimately be to increase the distinction and
reduce the present variations.</p>

<p>"There will almost certainly, however, always
remain a coloured class, the future of whom has
often been considered by travellers and anthropologists.
Some have gone so far as to say that they
will ultimately be the rulers of the West Indies,
but there is little foundation for such an opinion.
No doubt the lighter-coloured people will in time
take the place of the pure whites from their greater
suitability to the climate; their number will, however,
probably never be great enough to make
much impression. The coloured man is not so
aggressive as the educated negro, who has come
to the front in late years as a political agitator, and
who speaks of 'the people' as being those of his
own race, <span id="Fix_66">notwithstanding</span> the fact that in British
Guiana they are exceeded in number by the East
Indians.</p>

<p>"The negro is prominent in the Legislature and
the learned professions; he is the schoolmaster,
the dispenser or sick nurse, and the lower grade
clerk, but he does not succeed as a shopkeeper.
The gold and diamond diggers and balata-bleeders
are also black men under white superintendence.
He undoubtedly fills a place which, in his absence,
could only be occupied by inferior workmen of
other races, and is gradually becoming a useful
member of the community. As a plantation
labourer he fails, mainly because he expects
higher pay than estates can afford. He is capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of doing more hard work than any other tropical
labourer, but he prefers a job of a few hours rather
than steady, continuous work. His passions are
easily roused, and when the fit is on it is useless
to reason with him. After giving his employer
volleys of abuse he sometimes asks a favour as
if he had done nothing. Some will boast that they
bear no malice, that they are open-minded, much
better than some other people who will not forget
an offence. Morality is largely a matter of law.
'You can't do me nothing' is a common reply
when he is told that something he was doing was
wrong. Many of them are well versed in the law,
for crowds assemble round the magistrates' courts
every day. Sometimes one will say that if he had
ten dollars to pay the fine he would do something
illegal; in fact, it is notorious that people who
complain loudly of poverty can often pay fines
of what is to them very large amounts. One day
a poor woman will be begging a penny and the
next paying two to five pounds in the court. Yet
they have rarely anything saved, but the fines can
be raised by loans and gifts from their relations
and friends.</p>

<p>"The East Indian will certainly be the man of
the future in Guiana if the immigration system is
continued. Already he is ahead in British Guiana,
and forms more than a third of the population of
Surinam, if we include the Javanese. Though not
so strong as the negro, he is more reliable, and
without him there would be no Demerara or Surinam
sugar. He enjoys better health in the Tropics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
than other races, as is easily seen by the census
returns of India and the death-rates on the
plantations. A great increase of population may
generally be predicted where people are kind to
their children, and in this the East Indian is pre-eminent.
We shall say something further about
him in another place, and will only here deal with
his clothes. He is probably the only real tropical
man who dresses to suit the climate, and he is
always well dressed. With a few yards of cotton
cloth he drapes himself in a manner that could
only be emulated by a great artist. Any one who
knows what tight-fitting European clothing means
in the Tropics can appreciate the loose folds of
the East Indian. Through the ages he has learnt
how to dress in a graceful and picturesque manner,
which, however, is practically inimitable by others.
The women wear most gaudy colours, but their
taste is so perfect that there is rarely anything
discordant. And yet these people are hardly ever
of a higher class than that of the field labourer.
This natural taste in drapery and colour must have
been the result of experience during long ages;
that light clothing is a success is proved by the
natural increase, notwithstanding war, famine and
pestilence.</p>

<p>"The Chinese were imported as agricultural
labourers, but may be considered as failures in
that line, although in other respects very useful
colonists. They have been condemned in other
countries as undesirable, and even in British Guiana
they were once stigmatized as sly rogues and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
thieves. Now the stigma is undeserved, for they
form a trading class of considerable importance.
A few have worked at the gold-diggings as well
as in the forest as wood-cutters and charcoal-burners;
there is also a small agricultural settlement
on the Demerara River which is a picture
of clean economic cultivation. They are, however,
more conspicuous for their success in carrying on
small country shops, where the profits are hardly
sufficient to support people who are not content with
a very bare living.</p>

<p>"The only white men ever imported as labourers
were the Madeira Portuguese. Madeira was almost
ruined by the vine pest about the time of the slave
emancipation, and thousands of poor people came
to British Guiana. For want of care during the
year of seasoning many died, and the remainder
were found quite unfit for field work. They were,
however, useful colonists, and are now traders and
in many cases well-to-do property owners. They
came as paupers, but by thrift and industry went
ahead, until practically every spirit-shop and corner
grocery was in their hands. Only the Chinaman
can compete with them, and he only does so in the
villages. The Madeiran is a law-abiding citizen,
but he cringes too much to the negro. The general
result of the competition of the small shops is that
the poorer classes get their provisions very cheap.
Unfortunately, by giving way to the demands of
their customers, a condition of things has arisen
that no independent shopkeeper could possibly
endure. However, the Madeiran has learnt to bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and forbear, and he hardly ever resents the insults
and bullyings which the negress with her penny
is always ready to launch upon him. He is
generally looked upon as mean, and willing to stint
himself to save, but this is a character which is
generally wanted in the Tropics, where the tendency
to thrift is always sadly lacking.</p>

<p>"The native Indian can hardly be reckoned as
a member of the community; he is, however, useful
to the traveller, the gold-digger and balata-bleeder.
As a boatman, wood-cutter or huntsman, he is in
his place, but his sturdy independence prevents
him from becoming a reliable servant. Make him
your friend and he will do anything in his power
for you, but he takes orders from no one. This
refers to the man of the forest whose wants are
few, and when satisfied, there is no further necessity
for his working. For a gun, powder or shot you
may induce him to help you; when he gets these
he naturally wants to be free to use them. There
is, however, a class of half-civilized Indians growing
up who are fairly reliable, but they do not
remain in town longer than is necessary for transacting
their business as carriers of timber, charcoal
and cord-wood. No Indian man can endure the
trammels of civilization; sometimes a buckeen, as
the women are called, will take a place as house-servant,
but even these are not common. Unfortunately,
the men are given to rum-drinking, and
laws are made for the country districts to prevent
the sale to them of spirits.</p>

<p>"The real wild Indian is disappearing from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
old haunts. Forty years ago he could be found in
many of the creeks of the Demerara River where
now only a few of his degenerated descendants
exist. As a huntsman he must have a sort of
game preserve, which is impossible where gangs
of wood-cutters and balata-bleeders carry on their
work. He still exists, however, in the far interior,
living in much the same way as he did when
America was discovered, except that he does not
fight. The men are still expert hunters and fishermen,
and the women as proficient in cultivating
and preparing the staff of life, cassava-bread.
Their old weapons, the bow and blow-pipe, are
largely replaced by the gun, but the large
fishes about the rapids are still shot in the old
way."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The things of the natural world which meet the
eye of the observant traveller are of extreme variety
and interest here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nowhere in the world, perhaps, are such
beautiful adaptations to natural conditions and such
perfect interdependence. The trees bear nuts and
fruits to feed monkeys, rodents, birds, bats and
fishes, and because these are present in such
numbers the cat family is also well represented.
Again, every tree has flowers that require insect
fertilization, consequently myriads of insects are
here; these, in turn, are kept within bounds by
ant-eaters, birds, monkeys, lizards, and those classes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of insects which feed on them, such as mantids,
wasps and robber flies. In the water the smaller
fishes feed on fallen fruit; they provide sustenance
to the larger species, which in turn become the
prey of alligators and otters. On the ground, in
the water, and up in the trees the struggle goes on
by which the balance of life is kept even. Notwithstanding
this universal war on every side,
species hold their own and develop great capabilities
according to their needs. Beautiful contrivances
have been gained to suit the conditions
under which they live, among them being protective
coloration and the careful adjustment of means
to the end, whether to catch and hold or to get
away. The jaguar stalks the acourie so that not a
twig is snapped or a leaf rustled, but the sharp
rodent is always on the alert, ready to leave its
feed of nuts the moment it recognizes the nearness
of its foe. Under this pitch-dark canopy, through
which no glimmer of moon and stars can penetrate,
many a painful tragedy goes on every night. But
the acourie still lives, in spite of its enemies, for,
like its relation, the guinea-pig, it is very prolific.
The Indian says that every animal has its tiger;
he himself is one of these, and must move as
silently or be content to go without meat."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p></blockquote>

become a resort of travel, and possibly of much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>

<span class="headerlargefont">THE AMAZON VALLEY</span><br />

<p>The River Amazon, whilst it has not the classic
interest of the Nile, nevertheless appeals to the
imagination in a way that that now well-mapped
and travelled waterway may not&mdash;in its still mysterious
and gloomy solitudes, traversing the largest
areas of virgin forests on the face of the globe,
spreading its vast and numberless arms over an
area unexceeded in size by any other river.</p>

<p>The Amazon is born amid the high ranges and
the snowy peaks of the Andes&mdash;the greatest mountain
range in the world being a fit parent of the
earth's greatest river. These high streams watered
the territories where dwelt a civilization or native
culture, moreover, as ancient perhaps as that of
Egypt, the Andine people, and their successors the
Incas of Peru, the remains of whose temples and
habitations are still to be encountered on headland
and plateau in those high regions of the great
Cordillera, as we have already had occasion to see.</p>

<p>Except for a few towns upon its main stream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
which were brought into being by reason principally
of one natural product&mdash;the rubber of the
forests&mdash;the presence of civilized mankind upon its
waters or its shores is almost a negligible quantity.</p>

<p>The first echo of the white man's voice in the
woods and across the waters of the Amazon was in
the year 1540, when a party of intrepid Spaniards,
after the Conquest of Peru, trusted their fortunes
to its mighty bosom and floated eastwards into
a world of which they had no knowledge, and,
borne down by the current across an entire continent
for nearly three thousand miles, were carried
into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>The voyage is one of the most remarkable in
the history of fluvial, or indeed of any navigation.
Let us briefly recall it.</p>

<p>One day early in the above-mentioned year there
was movement in the city of Quito, the ancient
capital of the Shiris, in the northern kingdom of
the conquered Incas, when a body of Spaniards,
captained by Gonzalo Pizarro, brother of the
famous Conquistador of Peru, Hernando, set forth
to reach a fabled land of gold, an unknown El
Dorado, which Indians, imaginative or deceptive,
told their white masters lay far within the forest
fastnesses beyond the Andes, a land of "Oriental
spices," an empire in some beautiful and languorous
region which might far surpass in riches and
enjoyment anything which even Peru had yielded.</p>

<p>A clever guerilla captain, esteemed the best
lance and master of horse in Peru, Gonzalo Pizarro,
fired by the idea of this fresh conquest, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
together over three hundred Spaniards, part of the
retinue of the Government of Quito to which his
brother had appointed him. Half the company
were mounted, all were well equipped: a mountain
of provisions was borne by a band of four thousand
Indian servants; a great herd of swine was driven
in the rear, further to furnish food for the party;
and a thousand dogs, some of a ferocious breed,
to hunt down Indians should such be necessary,
completed the outfit. Quito lies in a broad recess
of the Andes, leaving which the expedition climbed
the forbidding and snow-crowned slopes which
lay between them and the forests beyond, and
disappeared.</p>

<p>Little did the members of this eager band, or
the folk of Quito, know of what lay in store, or
how the forces of Nature should overwhelm even
so well-prepared an expedition.</p>

<p>The many tributaries of the River Amazon that
have their rise in this portion of the Andes cut their
way through extremely rugged territory, profound
gorges, buried in tangled forests, where passage
even for a few travellers must often be cut out
through the jungle, and which to a large body of
horsemen offered almost impenetrable obstacles.
The intense cold and rarefied air of the mountain
solitudes caused considerable suffering to the explorers,
and the traveller to-day, whilst impressed
with the grandeur of the scenery of the high Andes
of Ecuador, crowned by the magnificent avenue
of snow-capped volcanoes of which Chimborazo
and Cotopaxi are the chief, gladly escapes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the inclement altitudes to the warmer climate of
lower elevations. Then, as now, the land was frequently
shaken and devastated by terrific earthquakes
and discharges from the volcanoes, and it
would appear that such a state of unrest was
abroad at the moment when Gonzalo and his party
appeared, as if Nature resented their intrusion.</p>

<p>However, at length a land known as that of
Canelas, or perhaps so named by the Spaniards
from the profusion of beautiful cinnamon-bearing
trees, the name being Castilian for that spice, was
reached. This was as far as the leader had
expected to come, and finding their hopes unrealized,
it would indeed have been well had the
band returned to Quito, reading from the dreadful
forest its true lesson. But, lured onwards by the
tales of the Indians, who persisted that a few days'
march beyond there lay a land teeming with gold,
and inhabited by civilized and docile peoples, they
pressed onward. Broad plains opened to the view,
those vast savannas of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Montaña</i> of the Amazon
plain, and trees of stupendous growth, such as
perhaps only the equinoctial regions of America
produces, interspersed with beautiful flowering
shrubs.</p>

<p>But it is a peculiarity of these regions that
Nature herein provides practically nothing for the
sustenance of man. Of extreme fertility under
cultivation, there is little of fruits or game such
as would support life, and the traveller to-day
caught in these vast solitudes without an ample
supply of provisions may wander about miserably,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
far from human aid, until he perishes. Moreover,
the incessant deluges of rain which descend upon
this part of America, and which are indeed the
sources of the mighty flood of the Amazon, cause
provisions to deteriorate and clothing to decay, and
add infinitely to the burdens of the traveller. So
it befel the band of Spaniards. Their provisions,
after several months of travel, had become exhausted,
and their clothing was reduced to rags.
Part of the herd of swine had escaped, and now
they were obliged to subsist on the lean bodies of
the dogs and of their horses, together with such
roots&mdash;often unknown and poisonous&mdash;which they
dug up in the forest.</p>

<p>In this condition Gonzalo and his companions
reached the borders of the considerable river which,
known later as the Napo, is one of the principal
Ecuadorian tributaries of the Amazon, and which
to them, accustomed to the comparatively small
rivers of Europe, seemed an enormous stream, for
so far they had not gazed upon the Amazon itself.
Some encouragement was derived from this river;
its waters were at least a living thing; its current
might be a highway leading to the desired land.</p>

<div id="Fig_78" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">IN THE PERUVIAN MONTAÑA.<br />
<p class="marginrightspaced">Vol. II. To face p. 78.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At a point where the Napo&mdash;after the manner
of many of these Andine rivers&mdash;rushes through
a narrow chasm cut like an artificial canal through
the last range of the mountains to escape to the
plain the band crossed, constructing a frail bridge
by the method of felling a huge tree across it, over
which men and horses painfully made their way,
losing, however, one of their number, an unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Spaniard, who, missing his footing, seized
with vertigo, plunged downwards several hundred
feet into the boiling torrent which thundered along
the rocky gorge.</p>

<p>Little was gained here. There was still no
prospect of the promised land. They were spent
with toil and hunger; their provisions and their
powers were alike exhausted. Tribes of savage
Indians were occasionally met, who fought from
behind rock or thicket with deadly poisoned arrows;
tribes such as still exist to-day in parts of this wild
region of the Amazon basin, and which still receive
the traveller in similar fashion. To go on or to
return&mdash;that was the question which now pressed
itself on Gonzalo and his companions. But still
the insidious tales of gold and plenty lured
them on.</p>

<p>At a point where the walls of the Amazon forest
closed in impenetrably upon the river verge, as
is the natural character of these waterways, monotonous
by reason of their enclosure of the trees
and creepers, and affording no pathway along their
banks, Pizarro called a halt. It was decided that
the present mode of progression was impossible.
They must take to the stream. A vessel of some
sort must be constructed.</p>

<p>Necessity aiding their efforts, the Spaniards, after
two months' work, built a "brigantine," a vessel
rudely constructed from the timber of the forest
joined together with nails from the horses' hoofs,
rendered watertight with the tattered clothes of
the travellers used in lieu of oakum, soaked in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
natural gums which abound in the trees, in the
place of pitch. This craft was capable of carrying
only part of the Spaniards: the remainder must
continue to force their way along the shore.</p>

<p>And now we hear of Orellana, destined to
navigate the Amazon, in this, the first European
vessel&mdash;born of the forest, however, and not of any
foreign seaport&mdash;to float upon its waters, the first
white man to do so. For although the mouth of
the Amazon had been visited by the Spanish navigator,
Pinzon, some time before, in 1500, the river
had only been ascended for some fifty out of its
several thousand miles of navigable waterway.
Orellana, the lieutenant of Gonzalo, was given
command of the brigantine, which aided in transporting
the weaker members of the party; and
thus, floating and journeying, the expedition proceeded
onwards.</p>

<p>But food, with the exception of "toads, serpents
and a few wild fruits," now gave out entirely.
The last horse had been eaten. Famine and death
stared the expedition in the face. They could not
go on on foot. It was necessary that the vessel
should be dispatched to obtain succour from that
fruitful land which it was still believed lay but a
few days distant, at a point where, according to
information obtained from wandering natives, the
River Napo united its waters with those of the
main stream of the Amazon. Orellana, with fifty
of the band, was instructed therefore to descend
the river and return with all speed with the
much-needed assistance. He embarked, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
brigantine and its company disappeared from view
round a bend of the river.</p>

<p>This was the last that Gonzalo and his remaining
companions ever saw of the vessel. They waited
for weeks, supporting themselves heaven knows
how, day by day straining their eyes, hoping to see
the form of the returning bark upon the waters,
but all was in vain.</p>

<p>Meantime, Orellana and his crew, borne down
by the swift current, reached in three days the point
of confluence of the Napo and Amazon, a mighty
flood of waters, but there was no sign of the land
of promise, and instead of being able to load up
with provisions and return, he could barely obtain
sustenance for his ship's company; nor did it seem
possible to make his way back against the current.
What should he do? Were it not better to proceed
on his way, descend the river to its mouth, reach
the Atlantic, proceed to Spain and the Court, and
cover himself with glory as the discoverer of the
great Amazon and all the vast territory it traversed
might contain? Eagerly his companions accepted
the idea. As to those left behind they must succour
themselves, and turning their prow downstream
again the brigantine pursued its way, swept along
for two thousand miles by the vast waters of the
river.</p>

<p>How they escaped the dangers of rocks, whirlpools
and savage Indians; how they found considerable
settlements of natives, and at length
reached the mouth of the river, and taking ship
arrived at the Court of Spain needs not to be related<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
here. Orellana received considerable honour at
the hand of the Spanish Sovereign, with command
over the territory he had discovered.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Gonzalo and his companions,
thus left starving in the Amazon forest, suffered
many vicissitudes and many lost their lives. They
were forced to return to Quito without having
reached any El Dorado of their dreams. The
backward journey was one of the most terrible
in the early history of America, and out of all
that great band which set forth with such high
hopes only about eighty Spaniards and half that
number of Indians returned to tell the tale&mdash;little
over a hundred haggard adventurers, who, falling
down on the floor of the cathedral, rendered thanks
to heaven for their own escape from the terrors
of the Amazon wilds.</p>

<p>Thus ended the first expedition to the Amazon.</p>

<p>It was Orellana who gave the river its name.
On his dangerous journey adown the current, his
band fought with what they believed to be an army
of women-warriors, or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Amazonas</i>, who rushing from
the depths of the forest, attacked the white men,
but who, in reality, were only wild Indians in loose
cotton chemises or shirts flying in the breeze. There
is no legend here of an empire of women.</p>

<p>That the Amazon could be navigated was again
shown later by Pedro de Texeira, who, with his
companions, performed the great feat of ascending
from the mouth of the river up to Quito, and
returning thence&mdash;a marvellous voyage for that
period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The River Napo, by which the Spaniards first
entered upon the main stream of the Amazon (there
was an earlier exploration of the mouth of the
river in Brazil), is but one of many great navigable
tributaries which traverse the territories of those
nations&mdash;Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and
Brazil&mdash;which lies partly within the region. Many
thousands of miles of such navigable waterways
intersect it, some of them very little known or used.</p>

<p>We may gain an idea of the size of the region
drained by the Amazon by noting that it covers
four-tenths of the entire area of South America.
Yet less than a hundred square miles of it is
cultivated, and its "population"&mdash;if the term may
be used for the bands of savage or semi-savage
Indians that dwell there and the few white settlements&mdash;number
perhaps half of that of the city of
London: a few million souls, who are lost in this
immensity of forest, jungle and river.</p>

<p>The chief obstacles to travel and development
in the valley are the broken or flooded nature of the
country, the impenetrable forests, through which,
except off the few trails, the traveller has to hack
his way by means of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">machete</i>, wielded by his
Indians. The heavy rains, the mosquitoes and the
malaria, the unreliability of the natives. Dangers
from wild beasts have been exaggerated. The worst
of these is the mosquito! The forests are not
teeming with beasts of prey, although they are to
be met with. Often the traveller may pursue his
way for vast distances without seeing any living
creature, and he must not depend upon game for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
any particular addition to his larder, for there is
little, in many regions. Food must be carried,
and the matter of transport is one of the most
serious obstacles. Without adequate supplies the
traveller will starve, and leave his bones in the
dismal forest, as has befallen many an adventurer
here.</p>

<p>Except by actual travel no adequate idea of
the Amazon forests can be obtained: of their
alternating gloom and splendour, of their superabundant
vegetation, of the impenetrable ramparts
of their dense foliage and matted trunks. The
forest is the largest area of virgin woodlands on the
face of the globe, extending back from the Atlantic
seaboard to the slopes of the Andes for more than
2,500 miles, and ranging in breadth from 200
miles on the coast, at the mouth of the river or
in Brazil to 900 miles between Venezuela and
Bolivia.</p>

<p>The marvellously rich flora is among the
wonders of the world. The principal characteristic
is in the variety of genera and species. A
single acre of ground may contain hundreds of
different species of tree and shrub, including palms,
acacias, myrtles, mimosas and others. The forest
is in this unlike the great coniferous or other
forests, and the condition is not favourable in a
commercial sense as regards the industry of timber-cutting,
although industrial kinds of its trees afford
the basis of profit. The trees are not always of
great height here, the average being perhaps a
hundred feet, with many kinds reaching two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
hundred feet, the shorter varieties being upon the
flood-plains.</p>

<p>The remarkable tropical growth is shown in the
myriad lianas, or creepers, which often bind the
mass together, overgrowing even the tallest trees.
The traveller who has had to cut his way through
these networks of vegetation can best understand
their impenetrability. Above his head may tower
that monarch of the forest the "Cow-tree," or
Massaranduba. This remarkable tree takes its
name from the milk, or milky sap, it yields&mdash;a
latex used in rubber-curing and for medicinal
purposes. The timber is valuable for shipbuilding,
and is also esteemed by railway-builders for
sleepers, the wood being highly resistant, whether
in air or water. Here, too, the mighty cedar rises
amid its neighbours, growing to an immense
height; its great trunk a hundred feet to its first
branch. The wood is light, strong, and susceptible
of a high polish and is valued for these qualities
for many purposes.</p>

<p>Here is another tree we shall view with a special
interest in these forest fastnesses. We shall
regard it with such interest not only for its
great height&mdash;for it is one of the loftiest on the
Amazon&mdash;but by reason of its familiar product,
as it is that which produces the Brazil nut. The
tree, however, will not be crowded by its neighbours,
loving the open ground. It is slender
relatively for its height, perhaps three or four feet
in trunk diameter. Of the two varieties one is
known as the Bertholetra, the other the Sapucaya.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The collector of Brazil nuts will have a care not
to approach the trees in a high wind, that is when
the nuts are ripe. For the nuts, enclosed in their
capsule or covering, are as hard and heavy as a
small cannon-ball, and will certainly crack his
crown if by mischance one falls upon his head.
Prudently he waits until the pod falls, or, opening
the lid with which Nature has furnished it, flings
the enclosed nuts abroad, where they may be
gathered. Many nuts, however, are wasted in this
dispersal. The only capital required by the nut-gatherer
is that involved in the ownership of a
boat.</p>

<p>In view of the appreciation of the Brazil nut
in foreign lands, and its high price, the industry of
its gathering, it would be supposed, might have
been more extensive.</p>

<p>The monarch, in a commercial sense, of the
Amazon forests is the rubber, the beautiful <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hevea</i>
and others. These have their own special habitat.
They are not found anywhere, but are solitary
in their nature.</p>

<p>For description of the animal life of the Amazon
we must turn to those works of naturalists and
travellers who have made this field their special
study. There we may learn about the manati, or
sea-cow, one of the most remarkable of mammals,
growing at times to a size of twenty feet in length,
having its home in the lower and larger reaches of
the river. The world of the monkeys embodies
fifty species. We find them up as high as the
denser parts of the Peruvian Montaña, and a colony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of these creatures in conclave is always a remarkable
sight, with their semi-human attributes. We
shall see the sloth, and hear and see the jaguar as
also the peccary. The alligator will be our constant
companion amid the backwaters, and a dangerous
and voracious one at times he proves. The
turtles may furnish the traveller with its flesh and
eggs for food, as it has done for the Indians always.
The traveller on occasion need not despise, moreover,
the flesh of the monkey, however repugnant it
may seem in life to contemplate the creature as a
constituent of the forest larder. The mighty boa-constrictor
will be seen by the fortunate. The
brilliant plumage of the many-hued birds is perhaps
a compensation of Nature for the lack of song of
the many feathered tribes of the valley. As for
the parasitic creatures, the ticks, the dreadful ants
and a host of others, the traveller here will rarely
fail to make their close acquaintance.</p>

<p>The western or upper edge of the Amazon Valley
differs much from the denser region such as that
to which the foregoing description regarding the
forest applies, conditions obtaining more particularly
in the Brazilian portion of the territory. This
upper edge&mdash;extending, however, in some cases a
long way to the east&mdash;is known in Peru as the
Montaña, and embodies a much more broken and
diversified landscape, more beautiful and more
habitable. Bolivia, Colombia and Venezuela also
partake in territory of this character, which is
formed by the slopes of the Andes.</p>

<p>As the traveller descends the eastern slopes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the Cordillera, whose tablelands and ridges we have
traversed in a previous chapter, and leaves behind
him the vast grass-covered uplands, with their
towering peaks, he enters upon the line of tree-life,
which lies at an elevation of perhaps 11,000 feet:
enters indeed upon another world. The climate
becomes warmer, the mists lie heavier, thickets of
flowering shrubs spread their beauty, cascades of
falling water are projected like giant fountains over
sheer precipices, and timber-clad ridge and profound
cañon, between whose walls the torrential
rivers now hurry eastwards, diversify the journey;
transformation scenes which delight the eye and
give an added zest to the arduous march.</p>

<p>A very small portion of the Montaña is occupied
or inhabited. The old Inca civilization did not
penetrate it, nor did the Spaniards of the Colonial
period, nor yet did the white folk of the Andine
Republics establish more than nominal sway over
savage nature and savage man in these remote
regions. Beyond the few settlers who live isolated
from the world, the folk consist of more or less
uncivilized tribes of Indians.</p>

<p>Each of these tribes generally bears its distinctive
name and has its various customs&mdash;curious, useful
or bestial. The Aguarunas of the Marañon build
fixed dwellings and cultivate the soil. They are of
middle stature, the women often well-featured, and
both sexes wear short garments, in distinction to
other tribes which go naked and unashamed. A
warlike people, fighting with poisoned arrows, they
have on various occasions destroyed the white man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
settlements. These people signal their messages
through the forest for long distances by means
of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tunduy</i>&mdash;a hollow log tautly suspended from
a cord attached to a tree, and which reaches the
ground, and struck hard blows with a club it emits
a far-carrying sound, which, under a species of
"morse" code, carries the message onward&mdash;a
kind of native "wireless-telegraphy."</p>

<p>The Campas Indians occupy an enormous territory
on the great Urubamba and Ucayali Rivers,
and have assimilated some degree of civilization
and are friendly to the whites. The Nahumedes
are those who attacked Orellana and were taken
for women-warriors. The Orejones are so called
from the practice of making their ears of enormous
size, by inserting weights in the lobes. The Huitoto
Indians, in Peru and Colombia, were those who
suffered under the excesses of the Putumayo, the
great stream descending from the Colombian
Andes.</p>

<p>It would be impossible here to enumerate the
many tribes of the Montaña. Some of them were
influenced by the Incas, and in consequence are
of a higher calibre. The Incas, according to the
legends, had a God-given mission to civilize the
rude folk of Western South America, and
marvellously they carried it out, in a way that
puts the modern white man to shame, with his
ruthless negligence or with the studied barbarity
he has visited upon the poor aboriginal rubber-gatherers.</p>

<p>Many of these tribes cultivate the ground and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
subsist upon the fruits of their toil. Many of them
have a more or less hazy belief in a Supreme Deity,
evolved from their inner consciousness or inherited
from the Incas or from the childhood of the world.
The tribes have no particular cohesion, and are
thus at the mercy of whoever may oppress them.
At the head of each tribe is generally a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">curaca</i>, a
chief chosen by reason of his superior strength or
ferocity. Often they dwell in huge community-houses.</p>

<p>The "Conquest of the Montaña" is for the
Peruvian people a matter of considerable moment;
the region, embodying what in the future may be
perhaps the most valuable part of the territory of
the Republic, and the Government is becoming
more humanely alive to its potentialities.</p>

<p>It has been calculated that the aggregate length
of navigable waterway of the Amazon affluents in
Peru exceeds 10,000 miles, for steamers varying
from a draught of twenty feet down to two or four
feet; that is during high-water period throughout
a part of the year. This navigability is reduced to
about half the distance in the dry season.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In
addition, the smaller channels for vast distances
may be utilized for canoe-journeys.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Oriente</i>, or corresponding region in Ecuador,
offers analogous conditions for navigation,
although more limited in extent.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In Colombia,
as described elsewhere, navigation is possible by
small craft from the fluvial system of the Amazon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to that of the Orinoco, a remarkable hydrographic
condition.</p>

<p>In Bolivia the Amazon system provides also some
10,000 miles of navigation (and the Plate system
a further thousand miles). The principal affluent
in Bolivia of this fluvial network is the Madeira
and the Mamoré.</p>

<p>The famous Madeira-Mamoré railway was built
to avoid the cataracts and rapids on that river,
and provides a link in a chain of 2,000 miles of
river navigation, serving Bolivia and Brazil. The
line has had a terrible history, in the deaths during
earlier explorations of the route and during its construction,
brought about by the adverse forces of
Nature in these forest wilds.</p>

<p>We reach the lower terminus of this railway
by the steamer which ascends the Amazon from
Para and Manaos, at Porto Velho, 1,000 miles
upstream from the last-named town, and here our
vessel, which may have brought us from Liverpool
or other European ports, lies 600 feet above the
level of the sea, where it has ascended under its
own steam, 2,000 miles from salt water. Here
the impenetrable curtain of the forest closes in,
and from it timidly emerge the harmless&mdash;if sometimes
cannibal&mdash;little Indian folk who dwell in its
sombre depths.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>"The northern region, including the territory
of Colonias, the department of El Beni, and a
portion of that of La Paz, is that in which the
river navigation is most considerable, for it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
in this region that the majority of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">barracas</i> are
situated. These are the establishments installed
on the river banks by which the rubber of the
region is collected. They are at the same time
warehouses for the storing of rubber and stores
containing the most varied merchandise. The
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">barracas</i> are often surrounded by plantations.</p>

<p>"Despite their number and their importance, the
rivers of this part of the country are subject to the
common fate of all the higher affluents and sub-affluents
of the Amazon&mdash;namely, a considerable
diminution of their waters during the dry season,
which renders the channels difficult and unreliable
on account of the obstacles which accumulate at
certain points. It is really only during the season
of high water that steam navigation is easy and
rapid; in general, on the Rios Beni and Madre de
Dios, the steamboats run freely from December to
May. From June and July the steamers encounter
increasing numbers of obstacles and are exposed to
the risk of a sudden fall of water, when the types
of vessel peculiar to each river come into use, particularly
from August to November.</p>

<p>"During the months of July and August navigation
is inconvenient on account of the expanse of
mud, which has not as yet had time to harden, but
is left uncovered by the falling waters on either
bank, making landing a difficult matter. The reefs
uncovered at low water and the entanglements of
tree trunks disappear with the rise of the waters,
and the steamers recommence running.</p>

<p>"Descending the rivers during high water, navigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
is both easy and rapid, but it is also rather
dangerous on account of the swiftness of the
current. It is difficult to estimate the time needed
to navigate this or that river, as the day's journey,
ascending or descending, varies according to the
river, the amount of water in it, the kind of vessel
employed, the amount of cargo carried, and the
crew which steers or propels the vessel.</p>

<p>"The vessels peculiar to the rivers of those
regions which do not permit of steam navigation,
and which are everywhere employed when the
waters are low, are the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">balsa</i> and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">callapo</i>,
each a species of raft; together with boats of
various dimensions&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">monterias</i> or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">batelon</i>, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">egariteas</i>,
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">canoas</i> or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pirogues</i>, the latter being dug-out
canoes.</p>

<p>"The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">balsa</i> is a raft consisting of seven pieces
or trunks of a peculiar and very light wood known
as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">palo de balsa</i> (raft-wood); these pieces are either
bound together or pinned with stakes of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chonta</i>, a
kind of black palm which is very hard. The fore
part of the raft is narrowed slightly, and the trunks
are arranged on a curve whose elevation is perhaps
eighteen inches, so that the sides are higher than the
middle. Each of the seven trunks is perhaps five
inches in diameter. On the framework thus made
is placed a platform of plaited bamboos, known as
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chairo</i>; this platform, which is intended for the
reception of the cargo, and on which any passengers
take their places, is called the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">huaracha</i>. At each
end of the raft a space of three to five feet is left
free of any covering; here sit or stand the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
boatmen who form the crew&mdash;two at the bow and
one at the stern. A good raft is usually twenty-two
to twenty-six feet long, by five to six feet wide, and
will carry about <span class="nowrap">7 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> cwt. of cargo, as well as the
three boatmen.</p>

<p>"A <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">callapo</i> or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">monteria</i> consists of two or three
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">balsas</i> lashed together; such a raft will carry as
much as 34 cwt. The crews of these rafts, according
to their dimensions, consist of three to fifteen
men; these men are Leco Indians, or Mosetenes,
or Yuracares, who are highly skilled in this kind
of navigation.</p>

<p>"The pilot is the captain of the crew; he is
naturally the calmest and the most expert; the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">punteros</i>, who are stationed at the two ends, are
the strongest; the rest are the rowers. The navigation
of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">balsa</i> is terribly hard work when
mounting against a current; as a rule two men go
ashore and tow the raft from the bank, pulling on
a rope some fifteen yards in length; a third, armed
with a pole sixteen or eighteen feet long, keeps
the raft a certain distance from the bank, so that
it shall not run aground. Where the water is too
shallow to float the raft, it must be dragged over
the stones in the bed of the river. In reaches
where it is impossible to make one's way along
the bank the raft is poled up-stream, a method of
progression which costs more effort and is less
speedy.</p>

<p>"The crew of a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">balsa</i> or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">monteria</i> will usually
navigate for some ten or twelve hours a day, during
which they will perhaps make nine or ten miles;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to rest, eat or sleep they go ashore, which action
is known as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">encostar</i>.</p>

<p>"The navigation of the Mapiri (one of those
rivers which run into the Beni) must be made in
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">balsas</i> or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">callapos</i> manned by Leco Indians. From
Mapiri the descent is rapid as far as Huanay, and
the only obstacles are a few sunken reefs, which
cause dangerous vortices in the impetuous stream.
Where the Mapiri takes the name of Kaka (river
of rocks)&mdash;that is, at the confluence of the Coroico&mdash;there
are many dangerous passages full of
surface rocks. This river finally flows into the
Beni.</p>

<p>"The Rio Boopi also leads to the Beni; rafts
like those of the Mapiri are piloted by Mosetenes
Indians. The passage is rapid, for at the outset
the river enters a narrow gorge, that of the Meniqui,
in which the current flows at a dizzy speed;
eventually the Beni is reached at Guachi. Rafts
are employed as far as Rurenabaque and Salinas
or Puerto Brais, as between the two ports there
is the dangerous passage of the Altamirani, which
is encumbered with rocks and rapids.</p>

<p>"The Rio Beni is then freely navigable by large
steamers as far as Riberalta, at the mouth of the
Madre de Dios, a distance of 473 miles. Steamers
cannot proceed to Villa Bella on account of the
Esperanza rapids or falls, which are 340 yards long
with a declivity of 18 feet; the river here is nearly
a thousand yards wide, and its depth is three
fathoms. The current is so rapid that boats and
rafts must be unloaded both ascending and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
descending. The railway now being built between
Riberalta and Guayaramirim will circumvent this
difficulty.</p>

<p>"The Rio Madre de Dios, on the banks of which
there are numerous settlements, is navigable for
steamers during the months of high water from
Riberalta as far as its remotest tributaries, such
as the Inambari, the Manu, the Tambopata or
Pando, etc.; during the rest of the year the journey
must be made in <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">callapos</i>. The navigation of this
river is difficult only about the middle of its course,
where there are two rapids, which are, however,
completely covered when the water is high. The
Madre de Dios is navigable by its affluents as far
as the outlying spurs of the Andes.</p>

<p>"To pass from this river to the Rio Acre there
is a choice of two routes. One may go overland
from the Carmen <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">barraca</i> to Cobija, or by water,
by way of the Rios Manuripi and Tahuamanu,
affluents of the Orton. The Orton, an affluent of
the Beni, is, like the Madre de Dios, navigated by
steam-launches during the season of high water,
and by other vessels&mdash;rafts and canoes&mdash;all the
year. Numerous <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">barracas</i> (rubber stations) lie
along the Orton, whence one can easily pass to
the Rio Acre."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The wealth of the rubber-bearing regions of
Peru and Bolivia has of late years been made the
subject of considerable study, but the industry
of rubber-gathering and export has been overshadowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
from a variety of causes. The Acre
territory in Bolivia and that of Colonias have been
regarded as regions of untold wealth in this respect.
Difficult roads lead thereto from the capital of
the Republic, but these, in some cases, are
extremely picturesque.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Hardly has one crossed the Cordillera when
on all sides, on the flanks of the mountains, far off
on the plains, in the valleys, the vast virgin forests
show as great sombre patches emerging from fields
of verdure. Varied as the vegetation which composes
them, some seem impenetrable, their huge
trees garlanded with lianas and loaded with innumerable
parasites. These trees are not of
great diameter because, being huddled so closely
together, they struggle upward to seek the air and
the light.</p>

<p>"Others, undulating in the wind, waving their
palmated crests, seem like the parks of some
destroyed Eden; they are often so burdened with
flowers that when the wind blows it is as though
the snow were falling. Some of these forests are
incessantly alive with myriads of splendidly
coloured birds and monkeys of every species;
others, on the contrary, are so full of silence and
shadow and mysterious solitude that the traveller
might believe himself in a virgin world.</p>

<p>"Everywhere innumerable watercourses drain the
country; some contain flakes of gold, but the
true wealth of the country is in its vegetation,
so marvellously vigorous and varied that even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
America the forests of the Amazonian basin are
proverbial.</p>

<p>"Although this region lies wholly within the
Tropics, it contains every plant and animal to be
found under the sun&mdash;from the cedar to the banana
with its velvet leaves, which never thrives but under
the Equator; from the jaguar to the heat-loving
monkey gambolling in the sun, and even, in the
great plains of the east, from the shepherd watching
his flocks to the collector of rubber and the
planter of cocoa established beside the rivers or in
the depths of the odorous valleys.</p>

<p>"Despite these natural advantages, the greatest
to be found on earth, civilized man inhabits this
region only at rare and isolated points. This portion
of Bolivia is still a wilderness almost unknown,
into which the Bolivians of the high plateau, attracted
and held by the metalliferous strata from
which they strive to tear their treasure, only come
by chance to tempt fortune by the exploitation of
rubber. As men are everywhere prone to
generalize, the territory of Colonias has the reputation
of being full of mosquitoes, Indians and
wild beasts, each category more dangerous than the
other. There is a manifest exaggeration here.
Certainly the mosquitoes are an objectionable race,
but they are not found everywhere, and as for the
Indians, if they have on occasion displayed a certain
malevolence&mdash;possibly justified, but of which
they themselves are always the first victims&mdash;they
are as a rule invaluable as boatmen and collectors
of rubber, and it is regrettable that they are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
more numerous. Remain the dangerous wild
beasts: well, they fear man far more than he fears
them, and moreover they speedily desert such
localities as man inhabits or frequents.</p>

<p>"The climate of the territory of Colonias varies
according to the proximity of the chain of the
Andes, the altitude, the abundance of watercourses,
and the direction of the winds. The temperature
in May, June and July is mild and agreeable,
moderately cool in the morning and evening,
varying between 53·6° and 76·6° from 6 p.m. to
6 a.m., and from 76·6° to 89·6° between 10 a.m.
and 4 p.m. during the hottest months (September
to December). Rarely does the thermometer rise
or fall above these extremes. The normal
temperature does, however, suffer a sudden fall
when the cold south winds blow that are known
as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">surazos</i>; they come in September and produce
violent storms with great and almost daily variations
in the temperature, which may give rise to
affections of the lungs and throat as the sequel to
sudden chills. The force and direction of the
winds contribute greatly to modify the salubrity of
any region; places reputed to be unhealthy have
become notably healthy when the forest has been
opened or closed in a given direction.</p>

<p>"The great defect of the climate here is the
abundance of the rains. They fall continually
through the whole rainy season, which lasts from
December to May. The vapours of the Atlantic
are brought up by the east winds, which are prevalent
at this season; on reaching the Cordillera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
they are chilled as the air expands and loses heat
with its increasing altitude; then the vapours condense
and fall in torrents of rain, which often lasts
for whole days together. But these rains are never
cold, so they are not unpleasant as such rains
would be in Europe; one braves them without
thinking anything of it, as in Europe one braves
a summer shower.</p>

<p>"When it does not rain (the dry season lasts
from June to November) the climate is delightful;
the middle of the day is hot, with a somewhat
heavy heat, although the sky is usually covered
with a diaphanous mist which tempers the rays of
the sun.</p>

<p>"Floods are caused not only by rains in the
western mountain regions, but also by local rains.
They are dependent on the slope of the surface
and the insignificant fall of the rivers. When the
larger rivers are full the tributaries rise because
their waters are dammed up or even flow backwards.
The waters then become stagnant in every
sense of the word, and decompose rapidly through
the action of the heat and the vegetable and other
detritus which they contain; at such times they
produce paludian fevers; principally in April and
May, when the waters begin to fall and the larger
rivers receive the supplies of stagnant waters
released from their tributaries. As the fall continues
the mud left uncovered on the banks
becomes an additional cause of fevers.</p>

<p>"These paludian fevers, which are prevalent
more especially during the rainy season, attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
more particularly the rubber collectors&mdash;an ignorant
and primitive population who know nothing of the
most elementary rules of hygiene. Careless or
imprudent whites pay the same penalty.</p>

<p>"The lack of medical attendance, intemperance,
negligence which results in the drinking of stagnant
water drawn from pools or swamps or from
the river banks; above all, the bites of the mosquito,
against which no protection is employed, and
which convey malaria to healthy but debilitated
persons: these are the causes of the ravages
occasioned by paludism in this region, as throughout
the Amazon basin.</p>

<p>"These conditions do not obtain throughout the
Territory; there are numerous healthy localities as,
for example, along the middle reaches of the
Madre de Dios, in all parts which lie at any
altitude, and in regions not subject to floods where
a portion of the forest has been cleared in order
to give the beneficent breezes a free course. On
the other hand, and we speak from long personal
experience, any healthy individual of robust or even
average constitution can maintain himself in good
health, suffering, in the long run, from nothing
worse than a little anæmia, by observing the following
rules:</p>

<p>"Do not drink stagnant water unless it has been
boiled; if one must drink unboiled water take it
from the river, not from the bank, but from the
middle of the current; do not walk or ride or exert
yourself in the morning fasting; cover the loins
with a belt of wool or flannel; take short but frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
baths or douches in order to facilitate perspiration
and to avoid congestion of the pores;
and in fever belts, or during the rainy season, take
daily, as a preventive, four to eight grains of sulphate
or hydrochlorate of quinine (in a cachet or
compressed in tabloids) as well as a few granules
of arsenic; finally, keep to an abundant and
nourishing diet and do not forget that the
nights being cool it is indispensable to take
warm clothing and good blankets; and, most
important of all, never omit the protection of
mosquito-nets.</p>

<p>"Such is the territory of Colonias and the
greater portion of El Beni, a land of magnificent
vegetation; it is regarded, not without reason, as
a country where tropical agriculture may have a
future before it. At present this vast country
possesses a population of only some 40,000 to
45,000 inhabitants, without counting its 15,000 to
18,000 wild Indians, a population of which the
greater portion if not the whole is occupied in the
production and transport of rubber, the chief
product of the territory and the neighbouring

rubber gatherers of the Amazon Valley were
brought strongly before the world some years ago
by the disclosures of the Putumayo, in Peru, when
it was shown that terrible ill-treatment was meted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
out to the aborigines of the forests, in the greed
for rubber. They were shown to be frequently
starved, flogged to death, or tortured in various
ways, their "crime" being that they would not or
could not bring a sufficient quota of rubber. A
powerful London company was involved in these
scandals, but the directors, when brought before
a Parliamentary Commission, protested that they
had no knowledge of the matter.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that cruelties are still
practised on the Indian folk, in the rubber-districts
of Peru and Bolivia, under the curtain of the forest,
although the authorities of these countries have
taken measures to endeavour to prevent these.</p>

<p>The condition of the rubber industry in the
Amazon forests are not, of course, all barbarous or
uneconomic. It afforded, or affords, a means of
livelihood to a considerable number of people, and
created wealth where there was little other means of
enrichment. It is, to an extreme, unfortunate that
the industry is, in parts, a dying one&mdash;superseded in
large measure by the active rubber plantations of
the Straits Settlement, Malaysia and elsewhere.
But it remains to be seen if, some day, under
better auspices, the Amazon industry will not be
revived. It also remains to be seen if the exotic
plantations of Malaysia will be permanent, or
whether exhaustion of the soil and other matters
with what is an exotic industry there may not lead
to deterioration, or decrease of the commodity and
its yield, although it is to be hoped that such
eventualities may not occur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>It is affirmed by experts that wild rubber is
superior to plantation rubber. One of the evils of
the Malaysian system is that whereby coolie labour
is brought in without their women, and consequently
no family life is possible among these
coloured workers. In the Amazon Valley there are
no such restrictions, and under better auspices the
native rubber-gatherer could prosper and multiply.
Herein lie important matters for the future, especially
for that fortunate part of civilized mankind
that rides on the rubber tyres of the modern
motor-car.</p>

<p>Let us cast a passing glance at a rubber
metropolis, here on this mighty South American
river, at Manaos, a name familiar at least to the
London reader of financial newspapers and to
the shareholders of British concerns thereat&mdash;for
British capital furnishes light, and power, and
docks, and other matters, for some of these Amazon
river ports.</p>

<p>Near that fork of the great river where on the
one hand the black waters of the Rio Negro come
down from a thousand miles' course from Venezuelan,
Colombian and Ecuadorian forests and
mingle with the muddy waters borne from the
Peruvian Marañon and its tributaries, there stood,
in the middle of last century, a riverside village
of Indians, a handful of Portuguese, negroes and
half-breeds. From this humble beginning a city
sprang to being, the geographical and trade centre
of the Amazon, with every comfort and every vice
of modern civilization. What was the cause of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
transformation? It was the discovery of the uses
of rubber, the exploitation of the "black gold" of
the forests. Manaos grew until the place, to which
all the rubber-producing lands of the neighbouring
Republics are tributary, provided ninety per cent.
of the world's supply of rubber. It has not, however,
given its name to this commodity, which has
been associated rather with that of Para, another
riverside city near the mouth of the Amazon, itself
created largely by this trade.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>"Formerly the basin of the Amazon was almost
unpopulated. In 1848 the city of Belem, the only
one in Amazonia, had 15,000 inhabitants, but two
years later an epidemic of yellow fever greatly
diminished their number. As for Manaos, even
thirty years later it was only a village; Mathews,
who visited it in 1879, estimated its population at
5,000. The Indian tribes of the forest refused to
work; and a few thousand half-breeds, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tapuyoz</i>,
a mixture of Portuguese, Indian and negro blood&mdash;were
utterly inadequate to draw upon the wealth
that men were beginning to recognize in the
bordering forests. Labourers were demanded on
every hand. The first immigrants, who settled
about Manaos, were Indians from Bolivia and
Peru; but their numbers were wholly insufficient.</p>

<p>"It was the influx of the inhabitants of Ceará,
during the draught of 1877-79, that made the
development of the rubber trade possible. From
that date the colonization of the forest proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
rapidly. The seekers of rubber dispersed themselves
throughout Amazonia; but the region most
regularly exploited was the basin of the Rio Purus
and that of the Rio Jurua. These two rivers are
navigable for a greater distance upstream than
any other of the affluents of the Amazon, and in
the virgin forest, which the rubber-seekers were
the first to invade, the exportation of rubber is only
possible along the navigable water-ways. The
Brazilians who mounted the Purus and the Jurua
did not stop at the Bolivian frontier; a war with
Bolivia very nearly broke out on the subject of
these lands, which a few years earlier had not
even been explored. The foundation of the
independent Republic of Acré, the treaty of
Petropolis, and the cession of Acré to Brazil,
were the result of the westerly march of the
rubber-seekers.</p>

<p>"The economic development of Amazonia was
prodigiously rapid. In 1890 it exported 16,000
tons of rubber; in 1900, 28,000 tons; in
1905, 33,000 tons. It became, next to San
Paulo, the most important centre of exportation in
Brazil.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The cities increased in size; the population
of Para surpassed 100,000; that of Manaos
attained to 50,000; and this growth of the cities,
which was more rapid than the growth of the total
population, is an index to the rapidity of the commercial
development of the country. The Amazon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
became one of the great river highways of the
world, serving not only the Brazilian Amazon, but
also the regions of Peru which are crossed by the
upper tributaries, and a portion of Venezuela,
where products descend to Manaos by the Rio
Negro.</p>

<p>"The exportation of rubber created wealth on
all sides. All other occupations were abandoned
for the collection of rubber. The herds of cattle
on Marajo and the cocoa plantations along the
banks were neglected. Similarly, in the neighbouring
districts of Guiana the fields and plantations
were abandoned on the discovery of 'placer'
gold. No one thought of anything but rubber.
Up to that time the country had produced its own
food; now it had to resort to importation. It
became a market in which the other States of
Brazil were able to sell their products at a highly
profitable rate. All these changes were due to the
importation of labour from Ceará."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have seen elsewhere that the ocean steamer
which carries us up the Amazon will reach the
Peruvian port of Iquitos, a place of much importance,
due to its position in the very heart of
the continent, the centre of a vast tributary region,
whose value the future will better be able to
estimate.</p>

<p>A region of the utmost interest lies before the
traveller who will adventure himself upon these
tributary streams and the diversified territories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
which they drain. There might be fleets of motor-boats
upon these waterways, whether bent upon
pleasurable exploration, whether upon business and
trade. The civilized folk of the eastern slopes of
the great Cordillera are, metaphorically, stretching
out their arms towards the east, casting eager
glances thereover, for from thence must come
economic prosperity and civilized peoples.</p>

<p>And now, once more, a glance at the past in
the great valley, though brief, at those influences
which have tried to make for good
as against evil: the forces of the Church and the
missionary.</p>

<p>The Jesuit friars in Brazil have had terrible
charges laid at their doors, but they and the Franciscan
friars did noble work in the forests and the
rivers among the savage or humble denizens.
Had their work been allowed to continue, it might
have flourished greatly. Among the missionaries
the name of the Padre Samuel Fritz stands out
(as did that of Las Casas in the Cordillera and the
coast). Fritz gave the greater part of his life,
from 1686, in work among these unfortunate
Indians. But the fighting between the Spaniards
and the Portuguese, around the forts built near
Manaos, destroyed this work. The Portuguese
dispatched armed bands against the Spaniards,
and destroyed the missions and the settlements,
waging war in their jealous pretensions over this
savage territory.</p>

<p>It will be recollected by students of history that
the Popes&mdash;among them Paul III&mdash;strove to protect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the Indians of the Amazon. This Pontiff, in
1537, issued a decree to the effect that "the
Indians were men like others." Later, alarmed
by the atrocities which were perpetrated in Mexico
and Peru upon the <span id="Fix_109">aborigines</span>, the Pope sanctioned
slavery as a means of avoiding such horrors. In
1639 Pope Urban VIII excommunicated the
captors and vendors of Indians, but later the
Portuguese Government allowed the establishment
of slavery. Under Dom John VI, the Indians were
to be considered as "orphans" in the eyes of the
law, and to be protected. But the present condition
of the Amazon Indians is one in which they
appear to have no civil or legal rights.</p>

<p>As regards modern missionary work here, this
is full of difficulty, for if it is to be carried out by
Protestants it involves a clashing with the Roman
Catholic priesthood, which naturally occupies the
whole continent. The work, however, whether by
Protestant or Catholic, is not by any means neglected,
although much greater effort is needful.
Such effort should go hand in hand with economic
elevation&mdash;also a difficult problem, due, in
part, to the attitude of vested interests in the
field.</p>

<p>It would but weary us to dwell upon the economic
possibilities of the Amazon Valley in detail.
Its climate and the fertility of its soil would render
possible the cultivation of all those tropical products
which are needful to the growing and hungry
world, which, complaining that the cost of life is
unbearable, is yet unable to set its hands to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
fuller development of the great fallow areas, among
which lies the vast Amazon territory. Here, then,
is work for the future.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We now turn to the huge Republic of Brazil,
mistress of the greater part of Amazonia, and of
much else.</p>

<h2><span class="headersmallfont">CHAPTER XII</span><br />
<span class="headerlargefont">BRAZIL</span></h2>

<p>When, in the year 1502, the early Portuguese
navigators entered the Bay of Rio de Janeiro&mdash;it
was the first of January, hence the name they
gave to what they believed to be the estuary of a
great river&mdash;they little dreamed of that superb city
which, as the centuries rolled on, should arise on
the edge of the sparkling waters, with their background
of picturesque mountains, with a harbour
perhaps the finest in the New World.</p>

<p>But such is the capital of Brazil to-day, and
the traveller approaching Rio de Janeiro revels&mdash;if
the weather be propitious&mdash;in the sunlit sea,
the emerald islets that stud its bosom, the palm-fringed
shores and colour of the vegetation
upon the mountain slopes, fit setting for the handsome
buildings, esplanades and avenues which
unfold to the view. Here the beauty of the
Tropics, shorn by modern science of much of its
lurking dangers, combines with the handiwork of
man to form a metropolis which South America
may contemplate with pardonable pride as an
instance of its civilization. In this vast oval bay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
which stretches inland for twenty-five miles, the
navies of the world might lie at anchor, and indeed
the flags of all maritime nations unfurl their
colours near the quays of this vast mercantile
seaport below the Equator.</p>

<p>It is a vast land which we thus approach.
Brazil spreads like a giant across its continent.
Its arms are flung westwards over South America
for over two thousand miles to the base of the
Andes, and from above the Equator to beyond
the Tropic of Capricorn, crowding its smaller
neighbours&mdash;if crowding be possible here&mdash;into the
extremities of the continent, an area in which the
countries of Europe might be more than contained,
and which is larger than the vast Anglo-American
Republic, the United States.</p>

<p>Still almost unknown are great portions of this
great territory, still inhabited by tribes as savage
as when first the white man set foot upon it, or
as when the faithless Orellana, Pizarro's lieutenant,
abandoning his companions in the heart of the
dreadful forests of the Amazon, floated down the
mighty waters of that river from the source to
the sea.</p>

<p>Brazil is, of course, not a Spanish American
country, although it was at one period under the
dominion of Spain; and it stands apart from the
remainder of the great sisterhood of the Latin
American Republics by reason of its Portuguese
origin and language, although the common Iberian
ancestry renders it similar thereto in other respects.
It differs, furthermore, in the constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of its people, in that the African negro race has
been so considerably absorbed into the twenty-two
million souls which form the population of
the Republic: an admixture which is of considerable
ethnological interest, and may have some important
bearing on the future relation of the white
and coloured races of the world.</p>

<p>The magnificent but somewhat incoherent land
as is Brazil to-day, offered at the time of its
discovery few attractions to the sovereigns of a
Mother Country into whose coffers the wealth of
Africa and of India flowed. Its poor and barbarous
tribes had no stores of gold ready to the
hand of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Conquistador</i>; there was no civilized
empire with a polity and architecture and organized
social life, with armies to protect it, such as
Mexico and Peru offered, and consequently neither
glory nor riches urged the European discoverer
or invader to tempt its hinterland and people its
valleys and seaboard. For thirty years the Portuguese
sovereigns paid little heed to this newly
acquired dominion, except that they fought off the
encroaching Spaniard and the adventurers of
France, who would have entered or traded with it.</p>

<p>Twenty years before the Conquest of Mexico
it was that the first explorer sailed the Brazilian
coast&mdash;and only eight years after Columbus had
sighted the American mainland&mdash;that the Spaniard,
Vicente Yañez Pinzon, a companion of Columbus,
with whom sailed Amerigo Vespucci&mdash;who gave
his name to America&mdash;sighted the shore of what
is now Brazil, near Cape San Augustine, reconnoitring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the mouth of the Amazon and coasting
along to the Orinoco. He took away some gems
from the Indians, some drugs and a load of dye-wood.</p>

<p>From this later commodity of the dye-wood, the
great dominion of Brazil took its name. "Brazil"
was originally a legendary island in the Atlantic,
which long retained its imaginary position in the
lore of the forecastle and upon the ancient
charts, and from this circumstance the name came
to be bestowed upon that enormous part of South
America which produced the red dye-woods
similar to those which bore the name of Brazil
in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>A few months after the keel of Pinzon had
furrowed these unknown seas, another explorer,
Cabral, close upon Easter in 1499 (<span class="smcap">O.S.</span>), following
the course of Vasco de Gama to the east,
was drifted by an adverse gale so far from his
proper track that he reached this same coast, and,
anchoring in Porto Seguro, erected an altar there,
celebrated Mass, set up a stone cross and took
possession of the country for the King of Portugal.
He, like Columbus, thought he had reached
India, and sent a vessel to Lisbon with the
news.</p>

<p>Let us turn for a space to examine the great
land thus brought to knowledge by these early
voyagers.</p>

<p>To-day, the traveller in Brazil will soon be impressed
by the immensity of its spaces, will
remark how broad are these wide tablelands, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
interminable the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">serras</i> and mountain ranges,
how boundless the forests. The territory of this
great land is fifteen times that of France. It is
larger than the United States (without Alaska);
it is over 2,600 miles long upon the Atlantic, and
2,700 miles wide from its coast to where, across
the heart of the continent, it touches the frontier of
Peru. Its boundaries touch those of every South
American nation except Chile. Persistent trespassers
were the Portuguese in the early Colonial
period, and their land-hunger carried them beyond
those boundaries which the Pope, as we have seen
in a former chapter, fixed between Portugal and
Spain.</p>

<p>What is the general nature of this great territory?
Here is a coastline with many sandy
beaches, mangrove swamps and lagoons, with
inland channels following the coast for long distances,
but giving place to rolling, fertile coastal
plains terminating in headlands overlooking the
Atlantic waves. The coast is indented with many
land-locked bays, forming large and easily accessible
harbours, with others smaller and difficult
of approach.</p>

<p>Back from this characteristic littoral, from Cape
San Roque&mdash;nearly the easternmost point of
South America, whose tropic headland here juts
out far towards Europe&mdash;and southward to Rio de
la Plata extends a vast tableland, covering half
Brazil, and beyond this we reach immense undulating
plains of sandy soil, forming the great
depression of South America from the basin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the Amazon in the north to the basin of the
Paraná River in the south.</p>

<p>Thus do we remark a singular incoherence and
lack of symmetry in the physiography of Brazil,
largely due to geological conditions. Yet Brazil
is a land which has been immune from violent
geological disturbances from an early time. Such
oscillations as there have been have not brought
to being enormous mountain chains or intensive
foldings of the rocks, such as are so marked elsewhere
in South America. Flat bedding or low
angles mark the geological horizons since the
Devonian Age, and since that age it would seem
that none of Brazil has been beneath the sea.
There are eruptive rocks in the Devonian and
carboniferous beds, but since the Palæozoic epoch
it does not appear that there has been any volcanic
activity. These <span id="Fix_116">devastating</span> forces of Nature
seem to have had their vent on the western side
of the continent. The Palæozoic beds of the interior
are of red sandstones, and these have their
place in marked degree in the economics and
appearance of the landscape.</p>

<p>The formation of the country has been interestingly
described by a well-informed recent writer,
whom we may quote here.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>"The high plains of the interior, which shed
their waters both north and south, have never been
of economic importance; the valley of the Amazon
has been developed only of late years, and its
population is as yet small. It is therefore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
tableland of the Atlantic seaboard, from Uruguay
to Ceará, that constitutes the soil of historic
Brazil. Through its length of 1,800 to 2,200
miles this tableland presents the greatest variety
of aspect, and has no hydrographic unity. Its
height is greater to the south, where it reaches
some 3,200 feet. This general slope from south
to north is revealed by the course of the San
Francisco. In Brazil the name of Borburema is
employed to denote the northern portion of the
plateau. This old geographical term deserves preservation,
as it represents a region which has its
own peculiar characteristics. The dry season
there is a long one, and the Borburema does little
to feed the small seaboard rivers which flow fan-wise
into the Atlantic; for the plateau in that
region slopes gently to the sea.</p>

<p>"It is otherwise in southern Brazil. From the
State of San Paolo southwards the seaward face
of the plateau is a huge bank, some 2,500 or
3,000 feet in height, which separates a narrow
strip of coast from the basin of the great rivers
inland. This long bank or watershed bears successively
the titles of Serra do Mar and Serra
Geral. From San Paolo to the Rio Grande no
river pierces its barrier; but the streams which
rise upon its landward side, almost within sight
of the sea, cross the whole width of the plateau
before they join the Paraná or the Uruguay.
Thus the Serra do Mar is not really a mountain
range; though it has, from the sea, all the appearance
of one, owing to its denticulated ridge; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the traveller who reaches the crest by crossing the
inland plateau arrives at the highest point by
the ascent of imperceptible gradients, and only discovers
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">serra</i> when he breaks suddenly upon
the sight of the ocean thousands of feet below.</p>

<p>"Beyond the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i> is the territory of Minas; a
confused mass of mountainous groups, among
which it is no easy matter to trace one's way,
either on the map or on the trail itself. An enormous
backbone of granite, the Mantiqueira, crosses
the southern portion of Minas; and the railway
painfully ascends its grassy slopes. The Mantiqueira,
which receives on its southern flank the
rains brought by the ocean winds, is the highest
point of the plateau, and the hydrographic centre
of Brazil. It gives birth to the Rio Grande, the
principal arm of the Paraná.</p>

<p>"As soon as we cross the southern frontier of
the State of San Paolo the plateau is transformed;
there is no more granite, and the landscape grows
tamer. The primitive measures of gneiss and
granite, out of which the Serra do Mar is carved,
are covered to the westward by a bed of sedimentary
rocks, of which the strata, dipping toward
the west, plunge one after the other under other
more recent strata. They consist exclusively of
red and grey sandstone, and the sandy soil which
results from their decomposition covers the western
portions of the four southern States. The topography
of the country changes with the geologic
structure. The outcrops of sandstone, which one
crosses in travelling westward, cut the tableland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
into successive flats. Irregular ranges turn their
abrupter slopes towards the east, as the banks of
the Meuse and Moselle in the basin of the Seine;
the rivers flow close underneath them, running
through narrow gorges. Even the least experienced
eye could never mistake these cliffs of
sandstone for ridges of granite; these are not
mountain chains, not <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serras</i>, but, according to the
local term, <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serrinhas</i>.</p>

<p>"In Santa Catharina and Rio Grande enormous
eruptions of basaltic rocks have covered a portion
of the plateau. The basalt has even reached
the seaboard, and southward of the island on
which Desterro is built it overlies the granites of
the Serra do Mar. The south flank of the plateau,
which overlooks the prairies of Rio Grande, is
also basaltic. The popular judgment has gone
astray, having given the same name&mdash;the Serra
Geral&mdash;to the granitic chain and to the edge of
the basaltic overflow, as if one were a continuation
of the other.</p>

<p>"If we except the prairies of Rio Grande,
where the pampas of the Argentine and of
Uruguay commence, there is nothing in front of
the Serra do Mar but a narrow sandy waste. The
rains which scar the face of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i>, wearing
it into ravines, do not irrigate it sufficiently; and
the rivers, of little volume, are spent in slowly
filling the marshes that border the coast; they
are lost finally among the granite islets, in the
deep bays which the first explorers insisted were
great estuaries. From the Rio Grande to Espirito<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Santo the Parahyba is the only river that has been
able to deposit, at the foot of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i>, and
around its outlets, a solid and fertile alluvial plain;
it is there that the sugar-mills of Campos are
established.</p>

<p>"It is the vegetation above all that gives the
various regions of Brazil their peculiar character.
It is a mistake to suppose that Brazil is entirely
covered with forests. The forests are concentrated
upon two regions: the basin of the Amazon
and a long strip of seaboard along the Atlantic
coast between Espiritu Santo and Rio Grande.
The forests require abundant rains; and the Serra
do Mar, receiving the humidity of the ocean winds
upon its dripping flanks, incessantly hidden by
mists, produces far to the south the conditions
which have made the Amazonian basin the home
of the equatorial forest. For a distance of 1,200
miles those who have landed at the various practicable
inlets have found everywhere on the slopes
of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i> the same splendid and impenetrable
forest. Even to-day it is almost untouched. It
encircles and embraces Rio; it seems to refuse
it room for growth, as in the tale of Daudet's, in
which the forest reconquered in a single springtide
the land which the intrepid colonists had stolen
from it in order to found their settlement.</p>

<p>"Beyond the belt of swamps which extends
along the coast, where ill-nourished trees, overladen
with parasites, struggle against imperfect
drainage and poverty of soil, at the very foot
of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i>, the true forest begins. The dome-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
summits of the great trees, ranged in ascending
ranks upon the slope, completely screen the
soil they spring from, thus giving the peculiar
illusion that this wonderful vegetation rises, from
a common level, to the extreme height of the
range. Here and there only emerges from the
foliage the smooth water-worn side of a granite
bluff. The railway track runs between walls of
verdure; the underwoods, which elsewhere suffer
from the lack of light, grow eagerly along the
sides of the trench-like clearing. Lianas, ferns,
bamboos, grow vigorously as high as the tree-tops.
One seems actually to see the brutal
struggle of the plants toward the sunlight and the
air. Many travellers have spoken of the sense
of conflict and of violence produced by the virgin
forest. There is, indeed, along the clearings cut
by man, and over the trees which he fells but
does not remove, a fierce battle between species
and species, individual and individual; a desperate
struggle for space and air. As always, it
is man who introduces disorder into the heart of
Nature. Far from his track order reigns, established
by the victory of the strongest; and
the forest which has never been violated gives a
profound impression of peace and calm.</p>

<p>"The <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i> is the true home of the equatorial
forest. But it covers beyond the ridge the
southern and western portions of the State of
Minas and the basins of the Rio Doce and the
Parahyba. The Martiqueira very nearly marks the
limit of the forests; beyond commences a dense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
growth of bush. I remember a long journey along
the northern slope of the range upon which is
built the new capital of the State of Minas, the
city of Bello Horizonte. Towards the north we
could see vast stretches of uncovered land; the
mountains were partly clothed with narrow belts
of forest, which climbed upward through the
valleys to the very sources of the streams; we
passed alternately through thickets of thorn and
prairies where the soil was studded with the nests
of termites. The dense trees, deprived of their
leaves by months of drought, were beginning to
revive, and were decking themselves with flowers,
of a startling wealth of colour unknown to the
forests of the humid regions. There it was that
the bush commenced. It stretched unbroken to
the north&mdash;unbroken save for the streams, which
were full or empty according to the rain they had
received.</p>

<p>"In San Paolo also and Paraná the region of
afforestation is not limited by the ridge of the
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i>. Forests and prairies alternate on the
plateau. The fires which the Indians used to light
in the savannahs have destroyed the forest in
places; yet man has played but a little part in
the present distribution of vegetation. The forest
has persisted wherever the natural conditions were
favourable, holding tenaciously to the humid
slopes of the hills or to rich and fertile soils.
Certain soils, either by reason of their richness or
their moisture, particularly favour the forest, while
on lighter soils the trees can ill resist the drought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
The diabasic soils of San Paolo are always covered
with a mantle of forest; so much so that a map
of the forests would be equivalent to a geological
map.</p>

<p>"The forest of the plateau, intersected as it is
by stretches of prairie, is less dense and less
exuberant than the forest the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i>; and as we
approach the south the difference is yet more
evident. Towards the boundaries of San Paolo
and Paraná the tropical trees are replaced by
resinous varieties. The immense pines of the
Paraná, with straight trunks and wide, flattened
crests, whose shape is rather reminiscent of that
of a candelabrum with seven branches, cover with
their sombre grey the wooded portions of the
plateau from the Paranápanema to beyond the
Uruguay. With their open foliage, pervious to
the light, these woods resemble the pinewoods of
Europe.</p>

<p>"To find the tropical forest once more we must
push as far as the Serra Geral, whose southern
slopes run down towards the prairies of Rio
Grande, as on the east they descend towards the
sea. There, on the basaltic flanks of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i>,
is a last fragment of the tropical woods. In magnificence
it almost equals the forests of Rio or
of Santos. It is the equatorial forest that makes
the continuity of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i>, not its geological constitution.
When the Brazilians speak of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i>
they think of the forest rather than of the mountains.
Incautious cartographers, who have worked
from second-hand data, which they have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
always interpreted correctly, have sown the map
of Rio Grande with a large number of imaginary
ranges. One seeks them in vain when traversing
the country; but one finds, in their place, the
forests which the inhabitants call <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serras</i>; the term
for mountain has become, by the latent logic of
language, the term for forest. Nothing could
better emphasize the importance of vegetation in
the Brazilian landscape; it effaces all other
characteristics.</p>

<p>"Forest, bush and prairie change their aspect
with the cycle of the seasons. The whole interior
of Brazil knows the alteration of two well-defined
seasons. The temperature is equal all the
year through; there is no hot season, no cold
season, but a dry season and a rainy season; this
latter corresponds with the southern summer. At
the first rains, which fall in September or October,
the wearied vegetation abruptly awakens. Then
comes the time of plenty, when earth affords the
herds of cattle an abundant pasturage. March
brings back the drought to the scorching soil.
The region of rainy summers includes all the State
of San Paolo, extending sometimes as far as
Paraná. Further south the rhythm of vegetable
life is no longer swayed by the distribution of the
rains, but by the variations of the temperature,
which grow always greater as one travels south.
From June to September frosts are frequent in
Rio Grande. The cattle on its pastures suffer
from cold as much as from hunger. Spring
returns, and the grass grows as the sun regains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
its power. This is the only portion of Brazil in
which the words winter and summer are understood
as they are in Europe.</p>

<p>"But the <em>ocean</em> side of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i> knows no
seasons; all the months of the year are alike; all
bring with them an almost equal rainfall. There
vegetation is truly evergreen, everlasting, unresting.
The ridge of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i> divides two different
countries. If it is true that the division of the
year into well-marked seasons, that powerful aid
to the agriculturist, is the privilege of the temperate
regions, then tropical Brazil is found only
at the foot of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i> and on its slopes; the
interior is another Brazil.</p>

<p>"Its advent into Brazilian history dates very
far back. The first colonists immediately climbed
the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i>, and so discovered the vast territories
which offered them a climate more favourable to
their efforts. The belt of seaboard was too narrow
and too hot to be the cradle of a nation. Colonization
was effected otherwise than in the United
States. In North America the pioneers settled
along the seaboard, in a bracing, healthy climate,
and there dwelt for a long period without any
thought of crossing to the west of the mountains
which limited their outlook. They prospered and
multiplied in their narrow domain, and, having
formed a nation, only then began to extend their
territories toward the west. In Brazil, although
the administrative capital of the colony remained
upon the coast, men quickly began to penetrate
the interior. To-day even to the seaward of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
plateau to which the immigrants made their way,
and which they have everywhere opened up for
exploitation by labour, the soil remains but
sparsely populated. While the forests of the interior
gradually recede before the agriculturist,
Brazil has kept the forest of the littoral intact,
and man has not disputed the claim of the woods.
They form, between the seaboard cities and the
agricultural regions of the plateau, an uninhabited
frontier, a sumptuous but deceptive frontage.
Many travellers know nothing of the country but
the seaboard forest. It deceives them as to the
nature of Brazil, and as to its economic progress.
The living members of Brazil are hidden behind
it as behind a screen.</p>

<p>"After the first astonishment has abated, and
when one has travelled far and for long periods,
the eyes at last become tired; they become inured
to the opulent scenery, and even find the landscape
monotonous. The sombre green of forest
or prairie everywhere hides the rocks; the soil
stripped bare by the roads, is of a dull, uniform
red; even the dust is red. Bright colours and
broken lines are equally rare. One travels continually
among rounded hillocks of green; the
humid climate hides or softens the contour of
hill and valley alike. The memories of one's
journey's blend and grow confused; reminiscences
of forests, skirted or traversed; clumps of banana-palms
near fordable streams; windings of the
twisted trail in the midst of undulating prairies."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p>From mountain slopes and forest glades let us
turn to glance into the Brazilian home, at the
Brazilian people.</p>

<p>In one sense, Brazil is an old country, as far
as any American nation may be termed so, and
in its three hundred years of life since the white
man became established within its shores life has
taken on a settled form and engrafted itself upon
its environment. It is a land of marked social
customs and distinctions. It has an aristocracy,
a culture refined and stable. Education, music,
poetry, the arts, are revered and enjoyed, and in
this sense the traveller is transported to the Old
World. Yet Brazil is democratic in its ideas, as
far as democracy has been possible in the Latin
American Republics&mdash;a matter which is of circumscribed
limits at present.</p>

<p>The foreigner, unless he specially lay himself
out to know the folk of the Latin American lands,
cannot readily look into their homes. They are
a people, as elsewhere remarked, full of reserve,
almost mediaeval in their seclusion, sensitive, yet
extremely hospitable and open-handed whenever
these barriers of reserve are penetrated. This is
naturally but the Iberian social character transplanted
to America.</p>

<p>It is to be recollected, moreover, that Brazil
was a slave-owning land, with all in social life
that that condition brings. Brazil was always a
viceregal or monarchical country too. The fall
of slavery in 1888 in part brought about the fall
of the empire. Thus we have here everywhere&mdash;except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
in the southern States where recent immigration
has brought other thoughts and customs&mdash;a
rigid ruling class and caste, the privileges of
an old society, such as does not exist in its neighbour
of Argentina, for example, and which is
foreign to the United States. Essentially an
agricultural country, the land, moreover, belongs
almost in its entirety to this ruling class.</p>

<p>Yet this condition of land-owning seclusion and
reserve is not necessarily accepted as a final and
irrevocable circumstance. "In the cities, and especially
Rio, where social life is more developed
and the national character tempered by contact
with foreigners of all nationalities, the country
magnates, ignorant of the ephemeral passage of
the fashions, are the subject of ready ridicule.
The country magnate's name is never pronounced
without exciting merriment."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>This is a curious circumstance, and shows how
custom differs in varying lands. In England, for
example, the "country magnate" is generally a
personage upholding all that is best in the
community.</p>

<p>In Brazil there is a marked taste for country
life, such as is scarcely yet developed in the
Spanish American Republics. The elegant suburb
does not necessarily attract the newly rich
Brazilian, who loves to return to the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i>, or
country estate. It has been said, however, that
this is less the result of delight in rural amenities
than in the lust of power, for in the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
he is absolute master, with a power over his dependants
stronger perhaps than in any other land.</p>

</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Says the writer before quoted: "One of the
qualities of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazendeiro</i>, one which I ought particularly
to mention, is his extreme hospitality. In
cordiality, delicacy and unfailing tact the hospitality
of the Brazilian surpasses the imagination
of the most hospitable of Europeans. The
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazendeiro</i> will make every possible effort to render
his house agreeable to you; if you wish to take
the air the best horse is at your service; or the
safest, according to your talents as a horseman;
the eldest son of the house will be your companion.
After dinner the family will search
among the gramophone discs for the latest music,
the latest French songs. In the morning, upon
your departure, your host, cutting short your
thanks, will assure you of the gratitude he owes
you for your visit. I have witnessed this scene
a score of times, and each time&mdash;whether or not
I owed such fortune to my French nationality&mdash;I
felt that I was received as an old family
friend.</p>

<p>"Such hospitality introduces one to the heart
of many families. These families, too, are large;
ten children are considered in no way extraordinary.
Paternal authority is respected; the
son, upon his entrance, kisses his father's hand.
The wife is occupied with household cares; the
husband's duty is to do the honours of the house.
A stranger rarely sees Brazilian women, except
as the guest of a Brazilian family. The women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
do not receive male callers; for them, or so it
seems to me, mundane life ceases upon marriage.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
They marry, I believe, very young, and are absolutely
under the marital thumb. Outside their
family their independent life is extremely limited.
Admirable mothers, one knows them rather by
their children than personally; they seem to
cherish their domestic obscurity. The traveller
who lands in the United States is immediately
surrounded, questioned, advised and chaperoned
by the American woman; there is nothing of this
sort in Brazil.</p>

<p>"In addition to its social authority, this
Brazilian aristocracy enjoys political power as
well. Brazil has, it is true, established universal
suffrage; but the sovereign people, before delegating
its sovereignty to its representatives, confides
to the ruling class the duty of supervising its
electoral functions. The large landed proprietors
choose the candidates, and their instructions are
usually obeyed. They form the structure, the
framework, of all party politics; they are its
strength, its very life; it is they who govern and
administer Brazil. And the administration is a
great power in Brazil. Its province is very wide,
and much is expected from it; whether the explanation
is to be found in Latin atavism, or in
the material conditions of life in this limitless
territory, or in the fact that the individual is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
powerless, and association so difficult. It is only
a slight exaggeration to say that the administration
plays the same part in Brazil as in a European
colony like Algeria, or as in India.</p>

<p>"Between the members of the all-powerful
administration who during my travels granted me
facilities, and their friends and relations, whose
hospitality I enjoyed in their <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazendas</i>, I was perhaps
in danger of becoming exclusively acquainted
with the superior social class of which a portion
directs the agricultural exploitation of the country
while the remaining portion governs it. It would
be a great mistake to suppose that this class, by
itself, is Brazil. I have done my best to see
beyond it, and to keep in mind the populace,
which is both more numerous and more diversified;
a confused mass of people upon whom,
before all else, the whole future of Brazil depends.
It lives under a benign climate; or at least under
a climate which makes impossible what we call
poverty in Europe. It is also a rural class; all
the agricultural labour of the country is performed
by its hands.</p>

<p>"In Southern Brazil the population has been
renewed, all through the second half of the nineteenth
century, by a stream of European immigration.
In San Paolo the Italians have provided
the long-established Paulista population with the
labour necessary to the extensive production of
coffee. They live on the plantations, in villages
which are veritable cities of labourers. Nothing
ties them to the soil; they do not seem to feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the appetite for land; very few buy real estate.
They bind themselves only by yearly contracts;
they readily change their employers after each
harvest. No more nomadic people could be
imagined; they change incessantly from <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i>
to <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i>. Neither is there anything to retain
them in the State of San Paolo; and not the
least danger of the coffee crisis is the exodus which
it is producing among the Italian colonists.</p>

<p>"Farther south, from Paraná to Rio Grande,
immigration has resulted in the settlement of a
very different population: a small peasant
democracy, composed of Poles, Germans and
Venetians. Being proprietors, they are firmly
rooted to the soil. Just as the influx of Italians
to San Paolo was not a spontaneous movement,
but the work of the Paulista administration, so the
German and Polish colonization of the south was
evoked and subsidized by the Government of Brazil
and the interested provinces. The newcomers
were sent into regions hitherto unpopulated, where
commercial communications could not be established
and economic vitality was unknown. There
they lived abandoned to themselves, without neighbours,
without customers. The political and artificial
origin of these colonies condemned them to
isolation; isolation kept them faithful to their
national customs and languages, which they would
soon have abandoned under other circumstances."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is seen that the Brazilian has a strong leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
towards the exercise of the intellectual gifts of
mankind. They are philosophical. The love of
scientific and learned titles is strong. The doctorate&mdash;of
laws, literature, medicine, science&mdash;has been
a coveted distinction, indeed has been carried out
to become a weakness or failing, a passion, as
among all Latin American communities. At one
time the ambition of every family capable of
affording a superior education to its sons was that
the boy should be a priest. That passed, and
then he was to be a doctor, in one of the professions,
and, moreover, to marry the daughter of
a neighbour who was also a member of the
learned class. Nearly all professions, it is to be
recollected, in the Latin communities carry the
doctorate with them. Nearly all statesmen are
doctors&mdash;when they are not military men, and then
the sword is apt to oust the diploma!</p>

<div id="Fig_132" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">A COLONY, RIO GRANDE.<br /><p class="marginrightspaced">Vol. II. To face p. 132.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now Brazil&mdash;and the same has taken place in
Chile&mdash;has abolished the doctorate as being
"undemocratic," has abolished the universities
and all their ceremonies and the cap and gown,
regarding them as too aristocratic-seeming, and,
in their place, a simple certificate of knowledge
is given from the "professional school."</p>

<p>This may seem destructive, but perhaps there is
a measure of wisdom in it, for apart from a
measure of danger in too marked social distinctions,
the system tended among the youth of the
country towards too great an aspiration for
academic honours, and not enough towards the
more practical and productive walks of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The aristocratic society of Brazil naturally
centred around the monarch, for, as we have not
forgotten, Brazil was the only self-contained
empire in the New World, except for Mexico's
short-lived monarchical regime. We may not here
trespass much upon the field of history, but we
shall recollect that, in 1808, the fugitive Portuguese
Court, under the regent, Dom Joâo VI,
sought Rio de Janeiro as his refuge. This advent
gave a stimulus to the growth of the capital, which
was opened to foreign commerce with the removal
of industrial restrictions, printing was introduced
and medicine and literature established. In 1822
Brazil declared its independence, with Dom
Pedro I as its emperor. The expulsion of
royalty in 1889, by a military revolt, was accomplished
without bloodshed, but under subsequent
presidents revolution reared its head.</p>

<p>Brazil is a land that has depended largely for
its prosperity upon the system of what may be
termed "monoculture," that is, the exploitation of
one principal crop or product. In earlier times
this was sugar; more recently it has been coffee.
This policy, whilst it had advantages, and, indeed,
may have been inevitable, has also serious disadvantages.
Such products are bound for foreign
markets and susceptible to the rise and fall of
exchange. The producers may be enriched or
impoverished by such fluctuations.</p>

<p>Moreover, "monoculture," as pointed out elsewhere,
tends to the sacrifice or neglect of other
interests, those of smaller and more varied industries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
which go to make up the life of a nation, to
increase its happiness, prosperity, knowledge&mdash;indeed,
to feed it and supply it. There is a
tendency to draw off labour under monocultural
systems from smaller occupations, from local food
supply and local industry, to herd labour into barracks
or congested places, to discourage individual
initiative and peasant proprietorship, concentrating
industry into too few hands. This condition is of
easy growth in such countries as Spanish America,
where raw materials, rather than finished articles,
are produced.</p>

<p>There are evidences, however, that Brazilian
Governments are awakening to these matters and
encouraging the implantation of a wider variety of
industry. Along such paths undoubtedly lies
greater national prosperity and stability.</p>

<p>The high protective tariffs of the Latin American
countries at the same time tend to raise enormously
the price of imported articles and to foster the
industries of the countries themselves. In Brazil
the national manufacturing industries have grown
very considerable under this system of economic
fostering. None is more striking than the cotton-weaving
industry, and we are already in sight of
the time when the country will cease to import
English or other foreign cotton goods, except perhaps
certain special kinds. This, of course, is
sound economics (however unpleasing it may be
for British manufacturers). Brewing and soap-making
are other industries that have similarly
prospered in the Republic. But, so far, factories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
are few, comparatively, though there is some useful
decentralization of manufacture. One finds
tiny factories in small struggling villages where
their presence might have been unsuspected, industries
brought about by the immensity of distance,
the high cost of carriage, which soon exceeds the
value of the finished product, and thus Nature has
here provided a sort of natural protective zone;
factories being established where customers exist,
and for the purpose of serving them, rather than
for the object of sale beyond their borders. Each
small factory has its own circle of customers, under
these circumstances, and can rely upon its market
close at hand. It enjoys a monopoly of its peculiar
region.</p>

<p>Apart from any defects to which such a system
may give rise, this may be regarded as a valuable
condition, and, if preserved, may avoid in Brazil
the serious evils which in some European countries,
such as England, over-centralization of manufacture
has given rise&mdash;a philosophy to which, however,
English people have not yet awakened.</p>

<p>Similar conditions exist as regards agriculture:
the dispersal or decentralization of industry is
necessarily accompanied by the dispersal or decentralization
of agriculture. Food products are
grown where they are to be consumed. Each
hamlet, and indeed each family, has its own fields
of maize, manioc and often sugar-cane. The
village is enabled not only to provide itself with employment
and with manufactured articles, but with
foodstuffs, and, in the future, this circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
might give rise to an intensive general settlement
and contentment.</p>

<p>For trading conditions it may have its adverse
side. But the question is how far trading should
be encouraged as against economic settlement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>"As a result of the difficulty of communications,
and also, perhaps, of the defective organization of
trade, Brazil is far from forming a national market.
Her territory may be decomposed into a host of
little isolated markets, each independent of the
other, each sufficing to itself. If the prices vary,
neither rise nor fall affects the outer world. In Rio
I find the sugar-planters in a state of joyful excitement:
in a few months the price of sugar has
risen by 100 per cent. Two days later I land in
Paraná; there, in the narrow tropical belt of seaboard,
are a few sugar-plantations, whose crop is
sold on the plateau; not in the shape of sugar, but as
'brandy,' <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">aguardiente</i>, or, strictly speaking, rum.
The local crop of cane is abundant, the owners of
the sugar-mills at the foot of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i> are grumbling
at having to sell their spirit at far below its
usual price.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Similarly the price of coffee will fall
in San Paolo and in Santos, until the Paulist coffee
industry appears in actual danger, and the State
undertakes the perilous business of running up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
prices to save the planters. Yet in Ceará there are
only a few growers, who can barely supply the
consumers of the State, who are selling an inferior
coffee at double the usual prices, and know no
other anxiety than the fear that the drought may
threaten their crops. Such contrasts are frequent.
If such is the case with luxuries like sugar and
coffee, what of the heavier products, whose transport
is still more costly?</p>

<p>"The limitation of the markets renders the economic
life of the country unequal and ill-adjusted.
It exposes it to continual partial crises which
naturally check its development. When production
exceeds consumption the local market cannot
unload itself upon the neighbouring markets, in
which the producers would perhaps receive better
prices, since these, on account of the cost of transport,
are shut off, as it were, by water-tight compartments.
Prices accordingly fall, without any
possible remedy; immediately production is limited
and becomes insufficient; then prices rise, and
there is no importations from without to limit
their rise. Reawakened by better prices, production
is once more stimulated; and its very improvement
provokes a new crisis. I found the
settlers of Paraná accustomed and even resigned
to the sudden leaps of the market, which they had
come to regard as a normal and inevitable state of
affairs. They live, therefore, always in a state of
uncertainty, never able to foresee what will be their
resources for the coming year. The spirit of
saving has decayed among them. In the same way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
wholesale trade used to suffer formerly from the
extravagant variations of exchange. The Brazilians
have at last come to understand the dangers
of such conditions. There is only one remedy: to
improve the means of communication. The great
question of Brazil is above all a question of
roads."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Brazil the question of means of transport is
a serious one. The magnificent network of railways
(largely built by British capital) serves only
the more settled part of the country.</p>

<p>The great export trade of Brazil, with its staple
products, furnishes a stream of gold, which, more
or less, becomes dispersed throughout the country,
and creates strong ties of union between the various
States, which otherwise might not exist in unison.</p>

<p>As to sugar, however, Brazil is in large degree
its own customer. The great export is coffee, as
it was once sugar, and in part rubber. Meat also
finds its principal market at home. Brazil will
soon supply its own wants in flour, which now
comes in part from Argentina.</p>

<p>The rise of the coffee-growing industry in
Southern Brazil, in the rich State of San Paolo,
has in it the element of an economic romance.</p>

<p>The condition was the result of Nature's geological
work here. It was discovered about the year
1885 that Nature had disposed large areas of what
came to be called "red earth"&mdash;a certain diabasic
soil of rich decomposed lavas&mdash;in this part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Brazil, and that the coffee-shrub flourished wonderfully
upon them. A coffee-planting "fever" was
the result. Rich and poor flocked in to take up
these lands and plant the berry; other forms of
agriculture were despised; all hunted for the red-earth
deposits, built their homes, set out rows of
young shrubs. The forests receded, cut down by
the axe of the new settlers. Towns sprang to being
as if by magic, where people were drawn from
the four quarters of the globe, from every nation.
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Fazendas</i> rapidly spread, railways were multiplied,
coffee occupied all minds. They thought it the
one thing on earth. Coffee was their art, literature,
religion.</p>

<p>Thus the great and to-day rich and handsome
city of San Paolo grew up, into which coffee pours,
to have its final outlet for the market beyond the
sea, at Santos&mdash;once a dreadful and fever-stricken
port, whose very name was anathema to the
traveller, now a fine and fairly healthy seaport of
vast importance.</p>

<p>The life and circumstances of the immigrants or
"colonists," as they are termed, in these coffee-growing
districts of Brazil is one of peculiar interest
for the student of race matters and human geography,
of great value in the science of colonization.
Here is an account by a careful observer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Each <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i> constitutes a little isolated world,
which is all but self-sufficient, and from which the
colonists rarely issue; the life is laborious. The
coffee is planted in long regular lines in the red soil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
abundantly watered by the rains, on which a constant
struggle must be maintained against the
invasion of the noxious weeds. The weeding of the
plantation is really the chief labour of the colonist.
It is repeated six times a year. Directly after the
harvest, if you ride on horseback along the lines of
shrubs, which begin, as early as September, to
show signs of their brilliant flowering season, you
will find the colonists, men and women, leaning on
their hoes, while the sun, already hot, is drying
behind them the heaps of weeds they have
uprooted.</p>

<p>"Each family is given as many trees as it can
look after; the number varies with the size of the
family. Large families will tend as many as eight
or ten thousand trees; while a single worker cannot
manage much more than two thousand.</p>

<p>"Like the vine, coffee requires a large number of
labourers in proportion to the area under cultivation;
it supports a relatively dense population.
The two thousand trees which one colonist will
receive will not cover, as a matter of fact, more
than five to seven acres; yet the coffee supports
other labourers who work on the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i>, in addition
to the labourers proper, or colonists. Pruning,
for instance, which so far is not universally practised,
is never done by the colonists, but by gangs
of practised workmen, who travel about the State
and hire themselves for the task. The colonist is
only a labourer; if he were allowed to prune
the shrubs he would kill them. Heaven knows, the
pruners to whom the task is confided ill-treat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
trees sufficiently already! They use pruning-hook
and axe with a brutality that makes one shudder.</p>

<p>"When the coffee ripens, towards the end of
June, the picking of the crop commences. Sometimes,
in a good year, the crop is not all picked
until November. The great advantage enjoyed by
San Paolo, to which it owes its rank as a coffee-producing
country, is that the whole crop arrives at
maturity almost at the same moment. The crop
may thus be harvested in its entirety at one picking;
the harvester may pick all the berries upon
each tree at once, instead of selecting the ripe
berries, and making two or three harvests, as is
necessary in Costa Rica or Guatemala. This
entails a great reduction in the cost of production
and of labour. San Paolo owes this advantage to
the climate, which is not quite tropical, and to the
sequence of well-defined seasons and their effect
upon the vegetation.</p>

<p>"At the time of picking the colonists are
gathered into gangs. They confine themselves to
loading the berries on carts, which other labourers
drive to the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i>; there the coffee is soaked,
husked, dried and selected, and then dispatched to
Santos, the great export market. All these operations
the colonists perform under the supervision
of the manager of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i>. A bell announces
the hour for going to work; another the hour of
rest; another the end of the day; the labourers
have no illusions of independence. In the morning
the gangs scatter through the plantation; in the
evening they gradually collect on the paths of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i>, and go home in family groups, tired after
the day's work, saving of words, saluting one
another by gestures. On Sunday work is interrupted;
games are arranged; parties are made
up to play <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">mora</i>, or Italian card games, with <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">denari</i>
and <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">bastoni</i>. Women hold interminable palavers.
Sometimes, on an indifferent nag, borrowed at
second or third hand from a neighbour, the colonist
will ride as far as the nearest town, to see his relations,
exercise his tongue, and pit himself against
such hazards of fortune as the world outside the
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i> may offer.</p>

<p>"What are the annual earnings of the agricultural
worker? The conditions vary in different
localities, but we may estimate that the colonist
receives about 60 or 80 milreis&mdash;£4 to £5 7s. at
the present rate of exchange&mdash;per 1,000 stems of
coffee. This is a certain resource; a sort of fixed
minimum wage. To this we must add the price of
several days' labour at about 2 milreis, or 2s. 8d.
A still more irregular element in the profits of a
colonist's family is the amount it receives for the
harvest. By consulting the books of several
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazendas</i> I was able to realize the extent of this
irregularity. Sometimes the wage paid for the
harvest is insignificant, while sometimes it is
greater by itself than all the other sources of income
put together. It is calculated at so much
per measure of berries given in by the colonist.
When the branches are heavily laden, not only is
the total quantity greater, but the labour is performed
more rapidly, and each day is more productive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Years of good harvest are for the
colonist, as for the planter, years of plenty. With
this important element essentially variable, how can
we estimate the annual earnings of the colonist?</p>

<p>"His expenses, again, cannot be estimated with
any exactitude. An economic family will reduce
them to practically nothing, if it has the good
fortune to escape all sickness, and so dispense with
the doctor, the chemist and the priest.</p>

<p>"What really enables the colonists to make both
ends meet is the crops they have the right to raise
on their own account, sometimes on allotments
reserved for the purpose set apart from the coffee,
and sometimes between the rows of the coffee-trees.
They often think more of the clauses in their contract
which relate to these crops than to those
which determine their wages in currency. A
planter told me that he had learned that a party
of colonists intended to leave him after the harvest.
We met some of them on the road, and I questioned
them. 'Is it true that you are engaged to
work on Senhor B&mdash;&mdash;'s <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i> for the coming
year?'&mdash;'Yes.'&mdash;'What reason have you for
changing your <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i>? Will you be better paid
there? Don't you get over £6 a thousand trees
here?'&mdash;'Yes.'&mdash;'How much do they offer you
over there?'&mdash;'Only £4.'&mdash;'Then why do you
go?'&mdash;'Because there we can plant our maize
among the coffee.'</p>

<p>"The culture of coffee is thus combined with
that of alimentary crops. Almost all the world
over the important industrial crops have to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
room in the neighbourhood for food crops. Every
agricultural country is forced to produce, at any
rate to some extent, its own food, and to live upon
itself if it wishes to live at all. In Brazil the dispersion
of food crops is extreme, on account of the
difficulties of transport; it is hardly less in San
Paolo, in spite of the development of the railway
system. Each <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i> is a little food-producing
centre, the chief crops being maize, manioc and
black beans, of which the national dish, the
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">feijoade</i>, is made.</p>

<p>"It even happens at times that the colonists
produce more maize than they consume. They can
then sell a few sacks at the nearest market, and add
the price to their other resources. In this way
crops which are in theory destined solely for their
nourishment take on a different aspect from their
point of view, yielding them, a revenue which is
not always to be despised.</p>

<p>"The colonists make their purchases in the
nearest town, or, more often, if the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i> is of
any importance, there is a shop or store&mdash;what the
Brazilians call a <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">negocio</i>&mdash;in the neighbourhood of
the colonists' houses. Its inventory would defy
enumeration; it sells at the same time cotton prints
and cooking-salt, agricultural implements and
petroleum. An examination of the stock will show
one just what the little economic unit called a
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i> really is. Although the colonists are to-day
almost always free to make their purchases
where they please, the trade of shopkeeper on a
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i> is still extremely profitable. He enjoys a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
virtual monopoly; the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazendeiro</i> sees that no competitor
sets up shop in the neighbourhood. The
shop is the planter's property; he lets it, and
usually at a high rent, which represents not only
the value of the premises, but also the commercial
privilege which goes with it. It is a sort of
indirect commercial tariff levied by the planter on
the colonists; a sign of the ever so slightly
feudal quality of the organization of property in
San Paolo. The custom that used to obtain, of
the planter himself keeping shop for the profit, or
rather at the expense of his colonists, has generally
disappeared.</p>

<p>"One of the most serious of the planter's
anxieties is the maintenance of the internal discipline
of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i>. This is a task demanding
ability and energy. One must not be too ready to
accuse the planters of governing as absolute sovereigns.
I myself have never observed any abuse
of power on their part, nor have I seen unjustifiable
fines imposed. The <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazendeiro</i> has a double task
to perform. He employs his authority not only
to ensure regularity in the work accomplished, but
also to maintain peace and order among the heterogeneous
population over which he rules. He plays
the part of a policeman. The public police service
cannot ensure the respect of civil law, of the
person or of property. How could the police
intervene on the plantation, which is neither village
nor commune, but a private estate? It falls to the
planter to see that the rights of all are protected.
Many colonists have a preference for plantations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
on which the discipline is severe; they are sure
of finding justice then. The severity of the planter
is not always to the detriment of the colonist.</p>

<p>"Individually the colonists are often turbulent
and sometimes violent; collectively they have
hitherto shown a remarkable docility. On some
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazendas</i>, however, there have been labour troubles,
and actual strikes; but they have always been
abortive. The strikes have not lasted, and have
never spread. One of the means by which the
planters maintain their authority and prevent the
colonists from becoming conscious of their strength
is the prohibition of all societies or associations.
They have had little trouble in making this prohibition
respected. Among an uneducated group
of labourers, of various tongues and nationalities,
the spirit of combination does not exist. We have
seen the development of working-men's societies, of
socialistic tendencies, in the cities of San Paolo,
but nowhere in the country. An incoherent immigrant
population, but lightly attached to the land,
is not a favourable soil for the growth of a party
with a socialistic platform. One must not look for
agricultural trade unions in San Paolo. The contract
between the planter and his labourers is never
a collective but always an individual contract.</p>

<p>"Accounts are settled every two months. It
often happens, even to-day, that the colonist is in
the planter's debt. The planter has kept up the
custom of making advances, and every family
newly established in the country is, as a general
rule, in debt. But the advances are always small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the colonist possessing so little in the way of securities;
he has few animals and next to nothing in
the way of furniture. His indebtedness towards
the planter is not enough, as it used to be, to tie
him down to the plantation; that many of them
continue to leave by stealth is due to their desire
to save their few personal possessions, which the
planter might seize to cover his advances. At the
last payment of the year all the colonists are free;
their contract comes to an end after the harvest.
Proletarians, whom nothing binds to the soil on
which they have dwelt for a year, they do not
resume their contracts if they have heard of more
advantageous conditions elsewhere, or if their
adventurous temperament urges them to try their
luck farther on.</p>

<p>"The end of the harvest sees a general migration
of the agricultural labourers. The colonists
are true nomads. All the planters live in constant
dread of seeing their hands leave them in
September. Even the most generous <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazendeiros</i>
experience the same difficulty. According to the
Director of Colonization, 40 per cent. to 60 per
cent. of the colonists leave their <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazendas</i> annually.
It is difficult to confirm this statement; but at
least it is no exaggeration to say that a third of the
families employed on the plantations leave their
places from year to year. Towards September
one meets them on the roads, most often travelling
afoot; the man carrying a few household goods
and the woman a newly born child, like the city
labourers at the end of the season. One can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
imagine what a serious annoyance this instability of
labour must be to the coffee-planter. Long before
the harvest the planter is planning to fill up the
gaps that will appear in the colony directly after
the harvest. He secretly sends out hired recruiting
agents to the neighbouring <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazendas</i> or to the
nearest town; he employs for this purpose some
of the shrewder colonists, to whom he pays a commission
for every family engaged. Finally, at the
end of his resources, if he no longer has any hope
of finding workmen in the neighbourhood who are
experienced in plantation work, he decides to apply
to the colonization agent in San Paolo, and resigns
himself to the employment of an untrained staff,
whom he will have to spend several months in
training.</p>

<p>"The instability of agricultural labour is the
most striking characteristic of rural life in the State
of San Paolo. It is a result of the unusual and
even artificial nature of the hasty development of
coffee-planting."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The colonists on the coffee-plantations are, in
the main, Italians, of whom there may be perhaps
three-quarters of a million in San Paolo.</p>

<p>The settlers or immigrants in Brazil, however,
are not all of the San Paolo type, and in other
parts of the Republic the condition of their life
differs altogether from those of the coffee-plantation
labourers. In Paraná, Rio Grande and elsewhere,
very diverse pictures of colonial life may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
be painted, more independent in their colours, with
less of the "rural proletariat." There are rural
democracies of small holders in some instances,
and a wide variety of products are cultivated, or
small industries pursued.</p>

<p>In Paraná, the famous and valuable <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">maté</i> is
largely grown, and the leaf of this small shrub&mdash;not
unlike the ilex, or evergreen oak, is exported far
and wide to Argentina, and other lands of the Plate,
and to Chile, across the Cordillera. For Paraná,
the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">maté</i> is what coffee is for San Paolo.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>"<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Maté</i> is not cultivated. It grows freely in the
forest, and in the forest its leaves are harvested.
As soon as plucked the leaves undergo a first
preparation, which is designed principally to
diminish their weight before transport, but also to
prevent their fermenting or turning sour. They
are dried at the fire, and are then packed in sacks
which are sent to Curitiba, where improved mills
reduce the leaves to powder, separate the various
qualities, and deliver the product ready for consumption.
Some colonists, more fortunate than
others, found on their allotments large numbers
of <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">maté</i>-trees; this meant for them a small fortune
acquired without labour. The <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">maté</i>-leaf, or <em>the
leaf</em>, as they call it in Paraná&mdash;a light but precious
merchandise&mdash;bears the cost of transport more
easily than maize; so that the owners of lots upon
which <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">maté</i> is found are able to make a profit by
the sale of their leaves. Such good fortune is
unhappily rare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"The great <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">hervaïs</i>, as they call the forest cantons
where <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">maté</i> grows abundantly, are nearly all in
the interior of the State; beyond the colonies, on
that portion of the plateau which approaches the
Paraná River; a country little known to geographers,
but which, thanks to <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">maté</i>, is not lacking
in importance nor economic vitality. At the
season for plucking 'the leaf' it is intensely animated;
a veritable army goes into camp, and all
the forest paths are busy. From the eastern border
the pack-mules carry their loads of leaves as far
as the roads which lead to Curitiba, capital of the
trade; and to the west the paths are no less
busy. There are Paraguayans, coming to take
part in the harvest, and Paraguayan smugglers,
who seek to cross the river without being sighted
by the Customs officials; for a large portion of the
harvest is destined for the border regions of Paraguay
and Misionès.</p>

<p>"In the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">hervaïs</i>&mdash;whether public or private lands&mdash;the
harvest is farmed out to contractors, who
undertake to organize it. They employ a
numerous staff. Each contractor constructs a
hearth for drying the leaves, and this hearth
becomes the centre of the little ephemeral world
which lives for a few months in the heart of the
forest, leading an isolated and laborious existence.
Four or five tons of leaves are often prepared in a
day. Some of the workers prune the trees; the
others dry the leaves. The gangs are recruited
from all over the State, and from the first day of
harvest the Polish colonies furnish a good number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of recruits. The men alone leave the colony, the
women remaining to take care of the allotments.
Some of the Poles are simple workmen, while
those with more initiative are themselves contractors.
All bring from the forests the money representing
their wages or their profits, and on this
money the colonies have managed to live."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here is a picture of the negroes on the sugar-producing
lands and elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A small proportion of the land belongs to
negroes. Small ownership among the negroes
dates from before the abolition of slavery. The
masters who freed slaves often gave them, with
their liberty, a piece of land to ensure their subsistence.
The negroes who have inherited these
small holdings are to-day the best element of the
black agricultural population. They form the
majority of a class of peasant proprietors, tilling
their land with their own hands, which also comprises
mulattoes and even a few whites. This
class is unfortunately too restricted.</p>

<p>"Taking them all in all, the negroes in the
sugar-producing regions like Minas form a type
of labourer of very indifferent economic value.
The very sun assures them of many alimentary
products, obtained without agricultural labour.
Fish swarm in the marshes of the coast. A child
will catch in one day enough to feed ten men. The
fish, indeed, save the blacks from the obligation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
regular labour. Although by no means the whole
of the soil is under cultivation, certain sugar-producing
districts are thus able to support a population
of extraordinary density, swarming like ants
in an ant-hill.</p>

<p>"In Bahia the sugar plantations have entirely
disappeared. In Pernambuco the majority of the
negroes live, as formerly, on the plantations. A
large number, however, have crowded into the
towns; for the negroes, who, in order to show their
independence, have scattered far from the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazendas</i>
on which they used to live, none the less hate solitude,
and are very eager for an urban life. In
Pernambuco and Bahia the urban population is too
large for the business capacity of the cities and
the activity of the harbours. Around the cities
properly so called stretch immense suburbs, vast
villages where the negroes live, without very appreciable
resources, among the mango and bread-fruit
trees. It is amazing, on crossing a <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i> in
Minas, or a Campos plantation, to see the number
of negroes who can lodge and feed themselves
on a minimum quantity of work. One feels the
same astonishment in the large villages of the
north. If you desire a boat, twenty boatmen dispute
your custom. In Pernambuco market I
remember having seen twenty merchants who had
between them a stock of fruit which could have
been carried in two baskets.</p>

<p>"To sum up: the moral and economic inferiority
of the negro population of Brazil is incontestable.
The puerility of the negroes is extreme.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
They have no foresight, and are innocent of any
form of ambition, the sole motive-power of progress.
They are modest in their desires and easily
satisfied. Whoever has heard, in the streets of
Bahia, the sincere, sonorous, joyful laughter of
some negro woman cannot fail to have experienced
the mixture of contempt, indulgence and envy with
which this nation of children inspires the Caucasian.
Their imagination is strong and nimble;
their sentimental life active; intellectual life they
have none. They are superstitious, and their devotion
has supported and still supports the four
hundred churches of Bahia.</p>

<p>"They amuse themselves with ardour. More
than half their life is devoted to amusements and
festivals. The circus is their favourite amusement.
The wit of the clown keeps them happy for hours.
Some of their festivals are connected with their
agricultural labours. They were formerly celebrated
on the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fazenda</i> by the slaves; they have
survived slavery. In Minas the black workers
still come, when the coffee harvest is over, bearing
in their hands boughs of the coffee-tree, which
they ornament with multi-coloured ribbons of
paper, shouting for the master to give the signal
for the rejoicings to commence."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In Southern Brazil we may still see the
picturesque figure in an old industry&mdash;the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">gaucho</i>
of the cattle-plains. The <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">gaucho</i>, or "cowboy,"
is a product of his calling, a creature of his kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
From childhood he has lived on horseback; has
early learned all feats of wild horsemanship, including
the throwing of the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">riata</i>, or lasso, and
the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">boliadeira</i>, the latter a thong with a ball at
each end which, dexterously thrown, winds around
the legs of a fleeing animal and brings it to
the ground. This form of lasso is peculiar to the
South American <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">gaucho</i>, and is unknown to the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">vaquero</i> of Mexico, whose marvellous exploits with
the ordinary noosed lasso, or riata, we may have
witnessed. Again, the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">gaucho</i> will stem a charging
bull by striking it across the muzzle with a short
whip, and he seems quite fearless at the animal's
onslaught upon him.</p>

<p>The life of this strange cattle-minder may be
lived on the lonesome <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">pampa</i> for long periods.
For his meat he may bring down a steer, cut off a
portion of flesh with hide attached, and lay it in the
embers of the camp fire, in rude cookery. He eats
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">farinha</i> with it, washed down with water, if his
wine or <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">aguardiente</i> has given out, but follows it
with the inevitable <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">maté</i>, the "Paraguayan tea."
He will not live in the town, he is a creature of the
plains. His wide-brimmed hat and silken or woollen
poncho and huge coloured neck-handkerchief,
raw hide boots, and enormous silver spurs, and
other decorated trappings, are the habiliments he
fancies best, and no ornate palace in Rio would
tempt him to abandon his free and independent
life.</p>

<p>Turning now to a different field; if the interests
of the traveller in Brazil lie in the rich world of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
minerals, he will not find here so varied and
historical a field as that we have traversed in the
regions of the Cordillera. Yet Nature has not
necessarily been niggardly even here. In centuries
past much gold has been produced, in <em>placer</em> and
other workings, and diamonds have been exported
for nearly two centuries. One of the most famous
gold mines of South America, indeed, the largest
and most constant producer of any on this continent,
is situated in the Republic, that of the St.
John del Rey, whose workings are a matter of
annual congratulation to its London shareholders,
with its plentiful dividends, distributed with almost
monotonous regularity to an amount approaching
at times to half a million sterling per annum. The
mine is of enormous depth.</p>

<p>Baser metals have also their possibilities here.
Brazil has been endowed by the geological operation
of Nature with immense deposits of iron, such
as we certainly do not encounter in any other part
of Latin America, and these we may survey in
the department of Minas Geraes. Very high-grade
ores of iron exist here&mdash;thousands of millions
of tons. Unfortunately the country has little coal
for purposes of smelting the ore, and the iron
industry may be largely confined to that of export
of the raw mineral.</p>

<p>Along the sandy coasts of Brazil another
mineral, found of recent years to be of value, has
been disposed. This is the peculiar monazite. There
are, in addition, many other metals and minerals
of commerce in various parts of the country: also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
petroleum. Perhaps the mining laws of Brazil
have not been so favourable to the foreigner as
those of the Spanish American Republics.</p>

<p>The general economic policy of Brazil, one
which with greater or less intensity seems to be
set before the Government and the intelligent
classes, is a scheme of self-supplying trade, commerce
and production in general, to produce its
own food supplies, to manufacture its own goods,
to be less dependent in these matters on the outside
world. The magnificent and varied resources of
the country are such as, as far as material is concerned,
would render this policy possible of fulfilment
as time goes on. It has been said by some
observers that the Brazilian hates trade. Be it as
it may, the country is very highly protected in a
fiscal sense. It is a wealthy land, and undoubtedly
has before it a future of such life and importance
as at present it is impossible to picture in detail,
but which might well be one of prosperity.</p>

<p>In Brazil there are innumerable matters of great
interest, whether in town or country, whether in
"the desert or the sown," which we have not space
here to consider; and the traveller and observer
will find material of the most varied and surprising
nature to absorb his energies, be they
in what field they may.</p>

<p>To the south, Brazil merges into those distinctive
regions of the great plains and rivers of
the Plate, which we now enter.</p>

<h2><span class="headersmallfont">CHAPTER XIII</span><br />
<span class="headerlargefont">THE RIVER PLATE AND THE PAMPAS</span><br />
<span class="headersmallfont">ARGENTINA, URUGUAY AND PARAGUAY</span></h2>

<p>The name of the River Plate, or the Rio de la
Plata, is one which falls familiarly on English ears,
or at least upon the hearing of those whose interests
in finance, stock and share, and bank and railway
of the South American shore, finds material of
activity in the South American "market" in the
city of London. They may not know the origin
of its name, nor whence it comes or whither it
flows. It is the "Silver River," named from the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plata</i>, or silver, which from the Inca Empire
adventurers brought that way, and to-day it carries
a stream of treasure to the pocket of the modern
shareholder.</p>

<p>As to the Pampas&mdash;a word we also owe
to the Inca tongue, this name must carry
memories to many a Briton and inspiration to
many another.</p>

<p>Here, then, we are bound for the Plate, towards
whose mighty estuary a fleet of England's steamships
constantly directs its course, together with
craft from other European lands, bearing traveller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
emigrants or merchandise; returning thence with
the foods of half a hemisphere.</p>

<p>This mighty stream of the Plate, with its tributaries,
is second only in size to the great Amazon
in this continent. But how different is its destiny
from that of the dark river of the Equator! If it
rises amid the savage wildernesses, at least it flows
through fruitful plains and waters the abodes of a
great civilization.</p>

<p>Let us pay the small homage to the River Plate
of first laying out the map upon our table, and so
mark its winding curves and mazy courses. They
come from mountain, from forest, from savage
jungle; they sweep from north and west, pour over
the cascades of Brazil, from the slopes of the far-off
Andes, from the dim forests of Paraguay; they
filter through the swamps of the Pilcomayo, a
perilous and savage stream, all in the heart of a
continent; the Paraná, the "Mother of the Sea,"
as the old Guarani Indians termed it, the Uruguay,
the Paraguay, giving their names to those lands
these full-flowing rivers caressingly encircle, all
sweeping down to east and south, perilous or
gentle, by foaming rapid or gentle current, past
fertile fields and many a handsome town, pouring
onwards for many a thousand mile, to empty into
that remarkable vent of the South American waters
and activity, the Plata Estuary.</p>

<p>A little over four hundred years ago, in 1516,
the Spanish navigator, Juan de Solis, the chief
pilot of Spain, bent upon that insistent search for
a strait&mdash;that elusive strait which in the minds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the geographers of that time showed a way to the
real Indies and the East, but which none found,
for the reason that Nature had not afforded one
there&mdash;found the great estuary of what is now
La Plata, a hundred and fifty miles wide. Back
to Spain with the news he went, returning with a
further mandate to explore, when he sailed up the
great waters for three hundred miles.</p>

<p>Here he thought to capture some of the Indians
of the "Mother of Waters," and to take them
with him to Spain. But they, resenting the pretension,
ambushed the explorer's party, and de
Solis was killed. Four years later Magellan
essayed the passage.</p>

<p>But the name of La Plata did not result from
these voyages. It was Sebastian Cabot, the Englishman
in the service of Spain, who, later,
ascending the great estuary then known as the
Mar Dulce, or fresh-water sea, discovered the
Paraná, and, following it and the Paraguay River
upstream, and landing where the city of Asuncion
now stands, found the Guaranis wearing silver
ornaments, and from these baubles&mdash;which, however,
came in reality not from the district itself
but from across the Andes, from the still unknown
Inca Empire of Peru&mdash;gave the name of the Plate
or Plata River.</p>

<p>Its wealth to-day comes not from precious
metals, but from the bounties of Nature in the
vegetable and animal world: the wealth of corn
and cattle.</p>

</div>

<p>Cabot established a settlement at San Espiritu.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
The rumours of a great, rich, unknown empire
fired his imagination. Then he returned to Spain
for means to open up communication with the
lands beyond the Andes. But in his absence the
garrison was massacred by the Indians. A chief
of the Timbus became enamoured of a certain
Spanish lady among the few colonists, and he,
striving to gain possession of her, caused the
treacherous murder of the garrison. Two years
after Cabot's return to Europe, the astounding news
of Pizarro's conquest of Peru arrived, in 1532,
and adventurous spirits were fired with the desire
themselves to set forth on similar quests of gold
and fortune. Among these spirits of the times
was the Marquis of Mendoza, and the story of
how he failed in reaching Peru forms one of the
interesting pages of history in this picturesque
period. Mendoza, on February 2, 1534, founded
Buenos Ayres, which has grown to the vast and
wealthy Argentine capital<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> of to-day. Some of
Mendoza's people, who had survived the dangers
to which many fell victims, founded Asuncion, the
first Spanish American interior capital, to-day the
capital of the Republic of Paraguay.</p>

<p>But let us turn to our map.</p>

<p>The Paraná River, rising in Goyaz, in Southern
Brazil, flows for 1,600 miles to its confluence with
the Paraguay, and thence 600 miles to the Plate.
Its main branch, the Paranahyba, drains a region
but little known on the southern watershed of
Brazil; and there are many other tributaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
which, although obstructed in places by rapids,
may be navigated in canoes, carrying the venturesome
traveller into regions wild and remote, amid
the rocky valleys and dense forests beyond the
Tropic of Capricorn. There are magnificent cascades
on these rivers, and dreadful rapids and profound
gorges, cut out by the river in the rocks,
through which the torrent plunges with frightful
velocity, its roar awakening the echoes of the
woods and the broken wilderness.</p>

<p>By the main stream of the Paraná our steamer,
of not more than twelve feet draught, reaches the
city of Paraná, and here we are 300 miles above
Buenos Ayres. Rosario, which we shall have
passed on the voyage upstream, is 185 miles from
Buenos Ayres, and may be reached by larger
vessels of fifteen feet draught.</p>

<p>To proceed now onwards upstream to Asuncion,
our steamer must not draw more than ten feet of
water, or it will strand on the shallows, but here
we are little short of a thousand miles from the
Plate, in the very heart of the continent. To
reach Asuncion, after five days' steaming up
this full-flowing river, we have entered a region
of gorgeous forests and beautiful backwaters, the
home of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Victoria regia</i> lily and of bright
plumaged kingfishers and of the alligator. Away
to the west lies the great Chaco plain or desert,
and the Pilcomayo River. The elevation of the
town is about 250 feet above sea-level, and thus
we have ascended to that altitude on the current.</p>

<p>To ascend the Pilcomayo River, the western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
affluent of the Plata, will demand more effort than
the easy passage of Paraná. It is a stream tortuous
and of great length, but of little volume in comparison
with those great streams which irrigate the
lands we have described.</p>

<p>Unexplored in part, this wild waterway has a
sinister reputation by reason of the disasters which
have befallen the early attempts to navigate its
waters. Its headwaters are in the Andes of
Bolivia, in the region of Sucre and Potosi, and
from thence to the edge of the Chaco the river falls
8,000 feet in 350 miles. It filters through a vast
and dismal swamp a hundred miles across, and traverses
numerous lagoons. Racing down the mountain
slopes the Pilcomayo crosses the great plain of
the Chaco and pours into the Paraguay River not
far from the town of Asuncion. Many tributaries,
many bifurcations, divide and lessen its current
on its winding course, which at times wanders about
in search of new channels, eroding and washing
away the soil of the Pampas; a desolate and capricious
stream. But one valuable asset of this and
kindred waterways in the future, we may reflect,
will be in the hydraulic power it is capable of
furnishing, an asset indeed of value, to be developed
some day, in a region where Nature has
omitted to furnish motive power in the more accessible
form of coalfields. Moreover, as this part
of the continent becomes more settled under the
growing exigencies of civilization, there is the
valuable function of irrigation to be developed.</p>

<p>A waterway of a very different character is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Uruguay River. We may trace its course for a
thousand miles, from where its many headstreams
flow down the slope of the Brazilian Serra do Mar,
or maritime range, leaving which the river runs
through beautiful country, open and hilly, for a
long distance. Great cataracts interrupt the
course, and, in places, contracted in width between
deep, thickly wooded banks, the stream is of
great depth, and its waters, flowing over a sandstone
bottom, are generally clear, with little silt.
It is subject to heavy floods by reason of the rains
in its upper basin, which at times submerge the
rocks which obstruct its current. But, apart from
its upper reaches, broad and full-flowing, the Uruguay
encircles the Republic whose name it bears
on its western side, and, falling into the Plate,
affords, in conjunction with the sea, a water-frontage
on three sides of the State, and is navigable
for 200 miles from its mouth as far as the
towns of Salta and Paysandu. Many hundreds of
miles of the river are navigable in smaller craft,
affording valuable waterways for the inhabitants
on its banks.</p>

<p>The enormous quantity of water of this great
fluvial system, pouring into the Plate, give that
estuary a greater volume than the great Mississippi.
At its mouth the Plate is 138 miles wide, and
opposite Montevideo, the Uruguayan capital, its
bosom is still 57 miles broad, whilst, narrowing,
it is 25 miles across at the confluence of the
Paraná and Uruguay.</p>

<p>The port of Buenos Ayres, however, is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
favoured by Nature as regards the depth of its
harbour, which is only kept open for ocean
steamers by constant dredging. This commercial
and maritime navel of South America thus suffers
from a considerable disadvantage. An outlay
amounting to over £12,000,000 has been necessary
to render the docks of the great entrepôt
always accessible to the numerous ocean steamers
which make it their haven. Before the artificial
channels were dredged, such vessels as drew over
fifteen feet of water could not approach within
twelve miles of the port, and unloading was
laboriously performed from launches.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that the shores of the estuary
of the Plate River, as we approach Buenos Ayres,
impress themselves upon the mind by reason of their
beauty. The city stands on a flat plain, without
background of hills or other pleasing topographical
feature, and its surroundings are, in consequence,
low and monotonous. The main objects
to break the skyline are the unhandsome forms of
giant grain elevators&mdash;those structures more
familiar to the traveller from the United States,
where they abound. Other outstanding objects
are the huge slaughter-houses, like those of
Chicago. The aspect of the place is, in fact,
strictly utilitarian. When, moreover, we read the
enthusiastic descriptions of the city, of its wealth,
its public buildings, its boulevards, we must
recollect that these features lie beyond the poor,
clustered dwellings near the water-front, of folk
who, largely necessitous immigrants, have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
unable or unwilling to proceed into the interior,
whether by reason of disillusion or from the abuses
they fear will be practised upon them. The
Argentine Government has done much towards the
settlement of the Republic, but the economic conditions
and humane direction of immigrants is one
which no Government has yet been able sufficiently
to compass. These considerations, however, may
be left for further remark elsewhere in these
pages. Buenos Ayres is a handsome city, a source
of pride to Argentina, and an instance of the civic
possibilities of the Spanish American race.</p>

<p>Before reaching Buenos Ayres we shall have
entered Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, the
smallest of the South American States, a seaport
and city more beautifully situated, extending
around the shore of its bay, with a rocky headland
jutting out in the west. Here the Atlantic
breezes blow freely over the city&mdash;situated on
its rolling lands, a city one of the cleanest in
the world and one of the most pleasing in
South America.</p>

<div id="Fig_166" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus-166a.jpg" width="600" height="396" alt="" />
<div class="caption">MAR DEL PLATA.<br /><p class="marginrightspaced">Vol. II. To face p. 166.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The sky of Montevideo seems unfailingly blue,
the sun shines constantly, the temperature is that
of summer, rarely falling below 50° even in winter.
The handsome harbour has been rendered safe for
vessels, and docks were built under large expenditure:
work carried out by national funds, without
the need of a foreign loan&mdash;that inevitable
Spanish American method of performing a public
work. Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Ayres have
their advantages, æsthetic or commercial, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Montevideo, in point of climate and other amenities,
is their leader.</p>

<p>On the opposite shore of the estuary stands the
Argentine city of La Plata, capital of Argentina,
a few miles inland from the port of Ensenada, a
provincial capital founded in 1882. The model
taken in its town-planning was Washington, but
the streets are of a width so considerable as to
give an air of disproportion, in conjunction with
the low brick buildings. Here we may visit the
most important museum in South <span id="Fix_167">America</span>, ethnographical
and archæological.</p>

<p>But to return to Uruguay.</p>

<p>We shall not confuse in our minds the two
Republics of Uruguay and Paraguay, as is often
done. The one is progressive and wealthy, the
other backward and poor. Their boundaries are
far from each other, separated by portions of Brazil
and Argentina, but they are united by the great
waterways of the Plate, as we have already seen.</p>

<p>If Uruguay is a small country in point of area,
being about the size of the British Isles, which is
not large in comparison with the vast areas of
territory of her neighbours on the Continent, the
Republic contains much that is important, both as
regards its own life and development and its relations
with foreign lands. As an indication of the
latter element, we may recollect the many millions
sterling of English money invested here in public
works and other matters.</p>

<p>The history of the land has been a chequered
one. War and peace have alternately succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
each other ever since independence was gained,
and the soil has had its full baptism of the blood
of its own sons. But much of this customary
dreadful history of Spanish America has here been
tinged by the patriotic spirit of the Uruguayans,
their strong national mind and their individualism.</p>

<p>The strange mixture of idealism and cruelty
which is found in the outstanding figures of Spanish
American revolutionary history is, we may here
reflect, remarkable. We find men who have lived
the dreadful lives of guerilla chiefs, with their
hands not merely stained with blood, but their
honour besmirched with the most horrible deeds&mdash;deeds
of torture, of treason, of massacre, of rape,
of robbery&mdash;sometimes enunciating the most philosophical
and beautiful sentiments or enduring
aphorisms. The dividing line between bloodshed
and cruelty and philosophy is, in Spanish America,
a very narrow one, and the Spanish American may
be called upon to cross it perhaps between breakfast
and lunch. We find such figures and situations
in every one of the twenty States of Iberian
America, from Mexico to Uruguay.</p>

<p>A national hero of Uruguay was Artigas, an
ex-smuggler who rose to be Dictator over a vast
territory; who rose with dramatic rapidity in the
turbulent times of the War of Independence and
the civil struggles that followed. It is not here
suggested that Artigas was of the character described
in the former paragraph, although some
historians have painted him in the darkest colours,
but opportunity is taken to show the varied sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of such characters, in their enunciations of lofty
sentiments. When, in 1815, Artigas was endowed
by the Montevideo Government with the title of
"Captain-General, Protector and Patron of the
Liberty of the Nation," he replied: "Titles are
the phantoms of States. Let us teach our countrymen
to be virtuous. It is thus I have retained the
title of a simple citizen." Now comes the flash
of philosophy. "The day will come," said this
guerilla chief, "when men will act from a sense
of duty, and when they will devote their best
interests to the honour of their fellow men."</p>

<p>Here is a further page from the early history
of Independence on the River Plate:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Artigas was now encamped for the first time
with a translated nation and an independent army
of his own. The condition of both was grimly
tragic, pathetically humorous. For fourteen
months almost the only shelter, that served for all
alike, was afforded by the branches of the trees
and the boards of the carts that had brought them.
As for the army, it was composed of strangely
heterogeneous elements. Honest countryfolk
rubbed shoulders with professional criminals and
cut-throats; Indians from the destroyed Jesuit
missions went side by side with fierce-faced
Gauchos; while townsmen, negroes and a
few adventurous foreigners made up the mixed
gathering.</p>

<p>"The men were in deadly earnest, since the
example of Artigas seems to have inspired even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the most depraved with a spark from his own
fire. Had it been otherwise they would undoubtedly
have succumbed to the disadvantages with
which they had to contend. Arms were scarce.
A certain favoured few were possessed of muskets
and swords; but the weapon in chief use was the
lance, the national arm of River Plate folk, the
point of which, here at Ayui, was usually fashioned
from the blade of shears or a knife, or from the
iron of some other agricultural instrument. Many,
however, had perforce to be content with a long
knife, with the lasso and the sling&mdash;the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">boleadores</i>&mdash;as
subsidiary weapons. Yet even these proved
by no means despicable in the hands of the men
whose sole garment was the ragged remnant of a
poncho tied about the waist, and who exercised
with poles in preparation for the time when a
musket should be in their hands.</p>

<p>"It was with the aid of an army such as this
that Artigas would cross the river to make his
incursions among the hills of his native country,
and would engage Portuguese and Spaniards alike
in battles from which the desperate and motley
companies of men would frequently emerge victorious.
Artigas was now assisted by numerous
minor chiefs, many of whom were of a character
quite unfitted to stand the light of day. Otorgues
and Andresito were the most noted of these. The
methods of the former were utterly brutal.
Although the fact is discredited, he is credited by
many with the order to a subaltern officer to 'cut
the throats of two Spaniards a week in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
preserve the morale. Failing Spaniards, take two
Buenos Ayrens for the purpose'!</p>

<p>"Andresito was an Indian from the deserted
Jesuit missions who commanded a considerable
force of his own race. He appears to have interspersed
his dark deeds with some evidence of
better qualities and even of a grim humour. A
coarse instance of this latter is supplied when he
entered the town of Corrientes in the heyday of
Artigas's power. On this occasion the Indian
troops behaved with no little restraint towards the
terrified inhabitants, and contented themselves with
levying contributions towards the clothing of the
almost naked army. This accomplished, Andresito
determined to exhibit the social side of his temperament.
He organized several religious dramas, and
followed these by a ball in honour of the principal
residents of the town. These, however, failed to
attend, their reluctance to dancing with Indians
overcoming their prudence. On learning the
reason from some crassly honest person, the
enraged Andresito caused these too particular folk
to be mustered in the main plaza of the town.
There he obliged the men to scour the roadway,
while the ladies were made to dance with the
Indian troops.</p>

<p>"Although no merit or subtlety can be claimed
for such methods, they at all events stand apart
from the rest in their lack of bloodthirstiness.
Compared with the sentiments revealed in a proclamation
of Otorgues in taking possession of
Montevideo, the procedure at Corrientes seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
innocuous and tame. One of the clauses of this
document decrees the execution within two hours
of any citizen who should speak or write in favour
of any other government, while the same fate was
promised to one 'who should directly or indirectly
attack the liberty of the province'! The humour
in the employment of the word 'liberty' is, of
course, totally unconscious.</p>

<p>"Such proclamations, naturally, served purely
and simply as a licence for convenient murder.
Employing lieutenants of the kind, it is little
wonder that much of the guilt of their accumulated
deeds should be undeservedly heaped upon
Artigas's head. Not that the Commander-in-Chief
himself was inclined to put a sentimental value
upon human life; indeed, a delicacy on this point
would be impossible in one who had passed
through the scenes of his particular calling. In
any case his hatred of robbery was deep-rooted and
sincere. After the execution of three criminals of
this type, he proclaims to his people at Ayui: 'My
natural aversion to all crime, especially to the horrible
one of robbery, and my desire that the army
should be composed of honourable citizens ... has
moved me to satisfy justice by means of a
punishment as sad as it is effectual.' A little later
he makes a similar appeal, adding, 'if there be
remaining amongst you one who does not harbour
sentiments of honour, patriotism and humanity, let
him flee far from the army he dishonours'! Here
we get the flowers of the south, earnestly thrown,
but alighting in too earthy a bed! The poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
army, with its impoverished, ragged loin-cloths,
and with its lassos and slings, undoubtedly valued
the occasional luxury of a full stomach at least as
highly as the abstract virtues. Yet they probably
heard the words with sincere admiration, feeling
an added pride in their beloved leader who could
employ such phrases. In any case&mdash;whether as a
result of punishments or proclamations&mdash;the crime
of robbery soon became rare almost to extinction
within the sphere of Artigas's influence.</p>

<p>"The war itself was each month growing more
savage in character. Such virtues as the Uruguayan
army possessed were recognized least of
all by the Spaniards. Elio, the Viceroy, had erected
a special gallows in Montevideo for the benefit of
any prisoners that might be captured, while
Vigodet, his successor, endeavoured to strike
terror by measures of pure barbarity. By his
order a body of cavalry scoured the countryside,
slaying all those suspected of Artiguenian leanings,
and exposing the quartered portions of their bodies
at prominent places by the roadside. Each patriot,
moreover, carried a price upon his head. It is not
to be wondered at that the Uruguayan forces made
reprisals, and that corpses replaced prisoners of
war."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>These matters took place a century or more ago,
as did the picturesque incidents of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Treinta y
Tres</i>, the thirty-three resolutes who swore to
liberate their country, when the news of the Battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of Ayacucho, in Peru, on the distant Andes, had
reached the land of the Plate and the Pampas.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The rejoicings that the victory of Ayacucho
aroused in the capital of Argentina stirred to the
depth both Lavalleja and a company of fellow-exiles
from the Banda Oriental. A meeting of
these patriots was held on the spot, the result of
which was an enthusiastic determination to place
their own country upon the same footing as the
rest. Doubtless many hundreds of similar gatherings
had already been effected&mdash;and concluded by
vapourings of thin air. But the spirit of these men
who had thus come together was of another kind.
Having sworn solemnly to free their country, action
followed hot-foot on the heels of words. A couple
of their number were sent at once to Uruguay to
prepare the minds of a trusted few, while the rest
made preparations for the expedition that was to
follow.</p>

<p>"The mission of the two deputies proved successful.
They returned to Buenos Ayres, the
bearers of many promises of support and co-operation.
Nothing now remained but to take the
first irrevocable step in the campaign that was to
bloom out from this very humble seed.</p>

<p>"'Treinta y Tres' has now developed into a
proper name in the Banda Oriental; for the
number of men who started out from Buenos Ayres
for the sake of Uruguay was thirty-three. The
name has now been locally immortalized. Among
the infinite variety of objects that it endows may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
be counted a province, a town, innumerable plazas
and streets and a brand of cigarettes.</p>

<p>"There is certainly nothing that is intrinsically
humorous in the adventures of these noble men
who set out for their patriotic purpose in the face
of such terrible risks. Yet as a specimen of the
constitution of the armies of the South American
factions at this period a survey of the grades held
by the small gathering is illuminating. In the
first place the diminutive expedition had for its
Commander-in-Chief Colonel Juan Antonio Lavalleja,
who had beneath him three majors and four
captains. These in turn were supported by three
lieutenants, an ensign, a sergeant, a corporal and
a guide. The remaining eighteen constituted the
rank and file of the force&mdash;in fact, the Army
proper.</p>

<p>"The little expedition so overwhelmingly
officered set out from Buenos Ayres, proceeding
northward along the Argentine shore. Reaching a
point where the river had become comparatively
narrow, they embarked in small boats, and
launched out on the Uruguay at dead of night. A
gale obliged them to seek refuge on a friendly
island, and caused a day's delay. But the next
evening they embarked once more, and reached in
safety the beach of La Agraciada on their native
shore. There they unfurled their chosen tricoloured
banner, and swore once again to attain
liberty or death.</p>

<p>"The expedition was now actually on the scene
of its mission, and shortly after daybreak it began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
its march to the north. During the course of a
few hours they collected <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">en route</i> reinforcements
of forty able-bodied and armed Orientales.</p>

<p>"Proceeding steadily onwards, the gallant little
army, officers and all, found itself in the neighbourhood
of the small town of Dolores, better
known formerly as San Salvador. This was held
by a garrison of eighty men in the service of
Brazil. Determined to inflict a first decisive blow,
Lavalleja led his men onwards to the attack. The
moment chanced to be especially propitious, since
the officers and principal men in the town had
attended a dance on the previous night. So great
had been the delights of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">baile</i> that the principal
men had found it necessary to continue their repose
long into the morning&mdash;a circumstance that is not
unknown even to this day.</p>

<p>"Had it not been for an error on the part of
the patriot guide the town would undoubtedly have
been captured by surprise and taken almost without
a blow. As it was, the official chanced to
mistake the situation of a ford in an intervening
small river. This necessitated a lengthy march
along the banks ere a place suitable for the passage
was found, and the presence of the small
company with the tricoloured flag was discovered
with amazement by the inhabitants.</p>

<p>"Thus ere Lavalleja's expedition had succeeded
in crossing the stream there had been moments of
wild bustle in Dolores. Officers sprang out of
bed to gird on their swords in haste; soldiers
ran to assemble with uniforms even more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
usually awry, while the municipal officers doubtless
ran to and fro in aimless confusion. Nevertheless
by the time that the turmoil was at an end
the garrison had had an opportunity to muster,
and to sally out against the advancing band that
had not yet gained the town."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To-day considerable prosperity is seen among
those who hold power and place, and control lands
and commerce in this enterprising Republic; and
the people of Uruguay have evolved their own
personality.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The hospitality of the higher classes is proverbial.
Indeed, reputable conviviality of all kinds is
at a premium. In Montevideo the occasions for
the giving of banquets are numberless. Thus if
a man has achieved something in particular it is
necessary that a banquet should mark the event,
if he has expressed his intention of achieving anything
in particular, a banquet forms the appropriate
prelude to the work, and if he has failed
to do anything in particular, there is nothing like
one of these selfsame banquets to console him for
the disappointment.</p>

<p>"It is, in fact, much to the Uruguayan's credit
that he contrives to extract a vast deal of enjoyment
from life in a comparatively homely and
unostentatious manner. The race meetings here,
for instance, are most pleasant functions, although
the horses are not burdened with the responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of those tremendous stakes that prevail in some
other parts. The theatres, too, although they
obtain the services of excellent companies, are
moderate in their charges&mdash;moderate considering
the usual scale that prevails in South America,
that is to say.</p>

<p>"The advent of a prosperity, however, that now
seems more definite than ever before has produced
a similar effect upon household expenditure as in
the neighbouring countries. The cost of living has
risen by leaps and bounds during the past two or
three years&mdash;a fact that salaried foreigners resident
in the country have found out to their somewhat
acute inconvenience. In the Campo, naturally
enough, this phenomenon of ways and means has
not occurred. When live stock and acres are
numbered only by the thousand such annoying
matters as house-rent and the butcher's bill fail to
carry any significance. Nevertheless, in Montevideo
the former has practically doubled itself
within the last half-dozen years, and all similar
items have followed suit as a matter of course.
But the rise in the price of land signifies prosperity,
and is at all events welcome enough to those
directly interested in the soil.</p>

</div>

<p>"South America, taken as a whole, is a continent
whose inhabitants are not a little addicted
to ostentation. The phase is natural enough in
view of the conditions that obtain in so many of
the Republics. In the case of the pastoral
countries, even in quite modern times the broad
lands had lain comparatively valueless until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
introduction of the freezing process for meat and
the opening up of the great wheat and maize areas
sent up the price of the soil by leaps and bounds.
Yet even prior to this era a certain amount of
prosperity had prevailed, and young South Americans
had become accustomed up to a certain point
to wend their way for educational purposes to
France and to England, and thus to assimilate
European ideas with those that prevailed at the
time in the Republics of the south.</p>

<p>"The sudden advent of overflowing wealth thus
found them to a great extent prepared to introduce
the most high-flown of modern ideas into the life
of their own country. No doubt the very consciousness
of these riches that, head for head,
undoubtedly far surpass that of the dwellers in the
Old Continent, caused the South Americans to fling
aside the last vestige of pastoral simplicity and to
make the roots of this great wealth of theirs bud
out into residential palaces and entertainments of
a rather fabulous order. Since they had shown
clearly enough that their material gains had surpassed
those of Europe, what more natural than
that they should endeavour to prove with equal
conclusiveness their ability to outshine the continent
of their ancestors in the ornamentation and
luxuries that follow automatically in the footsteps
of fortune! Surely the trait is nothing beyond the
proof of the healthy rivalry.</p>

<p>"The Oriental is undoubtedly a man of deeds;
but in his case the tendency to action is not effected
at the expense of speech. He is, indeed, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
born orator, and on the slightest provocation will
burst forth into a stream of eloquence that can be
quite indefinitely continued. In any case, it is
pleasant enough to listen to the resounding periods
in which the customary lofty sentiments are
couched, but it is as well to bear in mind that the
oratorical effort may mean very much&mdash;or very
little.</p>

<p>"Uruguay, more especially its capital, is well-found
in the matter of femininity. Indeed, ever
since it became a full-blown city Montevideo has
been celebrated for its pretty women. This fortunate
state of affairs has now become a well-recognized
fact, in which the masculine portion of
the community takes an even greater pride than
does the sex more directly involved. Should a
patriotic Montevidean be engaged in conversation
with an interested foreigner, the chances are that
it will not be long ere the confident question is
asked: 'And our señoritas, what is your opinion
of them?'</p>

<p>"In such a case there can be only one opinion&mdash;or
expression of opinion. Conscience may be
salved by the reflection that it is as difficult to
find a woman without some stray claim to beauty
as it is to light upon a dame of sixty without a
grey hair. In both cases the feature may be hard
to see. If so, it must be taken for granted. In
the case of the Montevidean señorita no such feat
of the imagination is necessary. To the far-famed
graces of her sisters throughout South America
she adds the freshness of complexion and the liveliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of temperament that are characteristic of
the land.</p>

<p>"Indeed, to conceive these lighter virtues, added
to the natural Spanish stateliness, is to picture a
very bewitching feminine consummation. Much
has been written concerning the señoritas of Uruguay,
and yet not a line too much. Their own
kith and kin have sung their praises with all the
tremendous hyperbole of which the Spanish tongue
is capable. White hands, bright eyes, raven hair,
and a corresponding remainder of features that
resemble all pleasant things from a dove to the
moon&mdash;the collection of local prose and verse on
the subject is justifiably enormous.</p>

<p>"The Montevidean lady has now, of course,
become essentially modern. She rides in a motor-car,
plays the piano instead of the guitar, and has
exchanged the old order in general for the new.
Yet the same vivacity, courage and good looks
remain&mdash;which is an excellent and beneficial thing
for Montevideo and its inhabitants. Indeed, the
beach of Poçitos or the sands of Ramirez shorn
of their female adornment would be too terrible
a disaster to contemplate even on the part of the
most hardened Oriental. And at this point it is
advisable to forsake for the present the more intimate
affairs of the people, leaving the last word to
the ladies, as, indeed, is only fitting&mdash;and frequently
inevitable.</p>

<p>"The Uruguayan's appreciation of pleasant
Nature is made abundantly clear in the surroundings
of the capital. The city, as a matter of fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
is set about with quite an exceptional number of
pleasant resorts both inland and upon the shore.
Of the former the Prado park and the pleasure
suburb of Colón are the best known. The Prado
is reached within half an hour from the centre
of the city by means of tramway-car. Situated
on the outskirts of the town, the park is very
large and genuinely beautiful. Groves of trees
shading grassy slopes, beds of flowers glowing by
the sides of ponds and small lakes, walks, drives
and sheltered seats&mdash;the place possesses all these
commendable attributes, and many beyond.</p>

<p>"The Montevidean is very proud of the Prado,
and he has sufficient reason for his pride. He
has taken a portion of the rolling country, and
has made of the mounds and hills the fairest
garden imaginable. The place would be remarkable
if for nothing more than the great variety
and number of its trees, both Northern and sub-tropical.
But here this fine collection forms
merely the background for the less lofty palms,
bamboos and all the host of the quainter growths,
to say nothing of the flowering shrubs and the
land and water blossoms. One may roam for
miles in and out of the Prado vegetation, only to
find that it continues to present fresh aspects and
beauties all the while.</p>

<p>"The expedition to Colón is a slightly more
serious one, since, the spot being situated some
eight miles from the centre of the town, the
journey by tramcar occupies an hour or so. As
much that is typical of the outskirts of Montevideo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
is revealed by the excursion, it may be as
well to describe it with some detail.</p>

<p>"It is only when once fairly launched upon a
journey of the kind that the true extent of Montevideo
and the length of its plane-shaded avenues
proper become evident. Nevertheless, as the car
mounts and dips with the undulation of the land,
the unbroken streets of houses come to an end
at length, giving way to the first <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quintas</i>&mdash;the villas
set within their own grounds. The aspect of these
alone would suffice to convince the passing
stranger of the real wealth of the capital. Of
all styles of architecture, from that of the bungalow
to the more intricate structure of many
pinnacles and eaves, many of them are extremely
imposing in size and luxurious to a degree. A
moral to the newcomer in Montevideo should
certainly be: Own a quinta in the suburbs; or,
if you cannot, get to know the owner of a quinta
in the suburbs, and stay with him!</p>

<p>"But if you would see these surroundings of
Montevideo at their very best, it is necessary to
journey there in October&mdash;the October of the
Southern Hemisphere, when the sap of the plants
is rising to counterbalance its fall in the North.
The quintas then are positive haunts of delight&mdash;nothing
less. Their frontiers are frequently
marked by blossoming may, honeysuckle and
rose-hedges, while bougainvillæa, wistaria and
countless other creepers blaze from the walls of
the houses themselves.</p>

<p>"As for the gardens, they have overflowed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
an ordered riot of flower. The most favoured
nooks of Madeira, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Midi</i> of France, and Portugal
would find it hard to hold their own in the
matter of blossoms with this far Southern land.
Undoubtedly, one of the most fascinating features
here is the mingling of the hardy and homely
plants with the exotic. Thus great banks of sweet-scented
stock will spread themselves beneath the
broad-leaved palms, while the bamboo spears will
prick up lightly by the ivy-covered trunk of a
Northern tree&mdash;a tree whose parasite is to be
marked and cherished, for ivy is, in general, as
rare in South America as holly, to say nothing
of plum-pudding, though it is abundant here.
Spreading bushes of lilac mingle their scent with
the magnolia, orange, myrtle and mimosa, until the
crowded air seems almost to throb beneath
the simultaneous weight of the odours. Then
down upon the ground, again, are periwinkles,
pansies and marigolds, rubbing petals with arum-lilies,
carnations, hedges of pink geranium, clumps
of tree-marguerites and wide borders of cineraria.
From time to time the suggestions of the North
are strangely compelling. Thus, when the heavy
flower-cones of the horse-chestnut stand out boldly
next to the snow-white circles of the elder-tree,
with a grove of oaks as a background, it is with
something akin to a shock that the succeeding
clumps of paraiso and eucalyptus-trees, and the
fleshly leaves of the aloe and prickly-pear bring
the traveller back to reality and the land of warm
sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it is time to make an end to this long
list of mere growths and blossoms. The others
must be left to the imagination, from the green
fig-bulbs to the peach-blossom and guelder-roses.
Let it suffice to say that a number of these gardens
are many acres in extent, and that you may distribute
all these flowers&mdash;and the far larger number
that remain unchronicled&mdash;in any order that you
will.</p>

<p>"As the open country appears in the wider
gaps left between the remoter quintas, and the
space between the halting-places of the tram is
correspondingly lengthened, the speed of a car
becomes accelerated to a marked degree. The
cottages that now appear at intervals at the side
of the road are trim and spotlessly white. They
are, almost without exception, shaded by the native
ombú-tree, and are surrounded with trellis work of
vines and with fig-trees, while near by are fields
of broad beans and the extensive vineyards of
commerce."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Montevideo, we remark, is a city whose population
may soon approximate to the figure of half
a million. It is fortunate, moreover, in possessing
good roads around it, for the country&mdash;unlike
Argentina&mdash;is seamed with good stone for highway
building, and thus the surrounding landscape may
readily be surveyed.</p>

<p>Before leaving Uruguay, we should cast a
glance towards its <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Campo</i>, the lands of its Pampas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"The Uruguayan Campo is not to be described
without a certain amount of hesitation. It would
be simple enough for one who had caught only
a distant passing glimpse of the land of the
pastures to put down the country without further
ado as rolling grass upland watered by many
streams. That such is the foundation of the
Campo is undeniable. Nevertheless to begin and
end with such a phrase would be equivalent to a
description of the peacock as a bird who wears
coloured feathers.</p>

<p>"The subtle charms of the Uruguayan Campo
are not to be discerned through the medium of
the bioscope-like glimpses that so many travellers
obtain of it. Very rightly, it refuses to reveal itself
fully until a certain amount of familiarity has
justified a nearer acquaintance. From an æsthetic
point of view it certainly holds far more than
might be expected from a country of such comparatively
limited attributes.</p>

<p>"If you desire to watch the moods of this rural
Banda Oriental, ride out to mount one of the
highest shoulders of the downland, and wait there,
either in the saddle or out of it. You will obtain
little sympathy in the task. Eccentric to the mind
of the estancieros, frankly mad in the eagle eyes
of the Gaucho&mdash;a calm survey of the Campo is
worth all such merely human depreciation!</p>

<p>"The aspect of the country in the immediate
neighbourhood of where the observer has taken
his stand will be green in the main, although the
unbroken verdure by no means obtains throughout.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Here and there the ground is strongly
marked by the occasional heaps of stones that
come jostling to the surface, and that recline in
the fashion of small bleak islands in the midst
of the green waves. But, should the time be
spring, these latter are themselves flecked
frequently almost to the extinction of their own
colouring. The great purple bands and patches
of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">flor morala</i> lie thickly upon the land. These,
however, stand apart, since where they glow the
serried ranks of blossom permit no others to raise
their heads.</p>

<p>"But these, though the boldest of their kind,
are by no means the sole occupants of the landscape.
Indeed, one of the chief characteristics
of the Banda Oriental Campo is the wealth of
beautiful and comparatively lowly plants that grow
amidst the grasses. They are of the type of
English blossoms, peering out shyly from between
the green blades, blowing purely and sweetly in
their innocence of the heavy sickliness of the
Tropics. It is where the ground is chiefly dotted
with these fresh flowers that the smile of the
Campo is most brilliant.</p>

<p>"So much for the immediate surroundings up
to the point where the more intricate markings
become merged in the broader tints of the landscape.
Down in the hollows are bands of dark,
close green formed by the trees that shade the
streams. With scarcely a break in the narrow
walls of verdure they run from valley to valley,
accurately defining the banks of the small rivers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
whose waters they conceal. Within these leafy
lanes lurk the only spots upon the Campo, save
for the rare woodland, that do not stare frankly
upwards, exposing all their earthly soul to the
blue sky.</p>

<p>"Away in the far distance there is a magic
glamour. There the lands are no longer green
to the eye. The soft waves, as they rise and
dip in an accumulation of folds towards the final
horizon line, are bathed in warm purple. The
Banda Oriental has been called 'the purple land'
by one who knew it well, and never was a name
better applied. Without the foreground&mdash;that is
itself strongly purpled by the banks of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">flor
morala</i>&mdash;all is purple and mystic. The land has
its ordinary mirages as well; but here is one that
at all times confronts the traveller&mdash;that wonderful
land of the horizon that, unattainable, dies farther
away as it is approached.</p>

<p>"Yet, notwithstanding its soft romance, the
place is essentially alive. It is a blowy haunt of
clean fresh airs that sweep the slopes and open
valleys to billow the grass tops and to refresh
mankind. It is amidst such surroundings that the
Oriental of the country dwells. His type is not
very numerous, it is true, and&mdash;although the dearth
of houses suits the landscape itself most admirably&mdash;the
scarcity of habitation is a little lamentable
in so wealthy and pleasant a land. It is practically
certain, as a matter of fact, that the pastures will
bear more roots in the near future than they have
ever known in the past; but in the meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
it is necessary to take them as they are, and their
inhabitants as well.</p>

<p>"Of these inhabitants the true <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">paisano</i>, the
Gaucho, decidedly claims the chief share of attention.
The Gaucho of the Banda Oriental is not
to be confused with his brethren of the neighbouring
countries. In appearance he presents
perhaps the finest specimen amongst the various
kindred families of his race. He is taller in
stature, and, if possible, even more athletic in his
lithe frame than his neighbour. His complexion,
moreover, though frequently dusky and invariably
tanned, is peculiarly wholesome and fresh. It was
inevitable that the blowy downlands should have
produced a fitting and appropriate breed of
amazingly healthy, hardy and fearless men to
whom the art of horsemanship has become second
nature, while the occasional enforced spells of
pedestrianism have degenerated into a mere unwelcome
accident of life.</p>

<p>"The temperament of the Uruguayan Gaucho
shows corresponding distinction from that of the
rest. It goes without saying that he is strongly
imbued with the grim dignity of the race. Silent
austerity here, however, is modified by lighter
traits. In the same way as the higher social
member of his country, he is more easily moved
to laughter than his neighbours, and indulges from
time to time in frank outbursts of joviality.</p>

<p>"For practical purposes it is necessary to
regard this child of the Campo from three standpoints&mdash;from
that of the worker, the player and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the fighter. It is rare enough that one of them
is not called upon to fill all these three rôles on
a good many occasions during his lifetime. As
stock-rider, he has proved his courage, fidelity and
honesty of purpose to the full; his moments of
recreation are taken up by equestrian sports,
guitar-playing and chance affairs of the heart,
whilst in warfare he has had only too many
opportunities of displaying his reckless brilliancy&mdash;frequently,
it must be admitted, at the cost of
discipline and order.</p>

<p>"In his private quarrels the Argentine Gaucho
will bottle up his wrath until his overflowing
passion culminates without warning in the rapid
knife thrust or revolver shot. The conclusion of
a serious dispute between his Uruguayan brethren
will almost certainly be the same; but the tragic
climax will be approached in quite another fashion.
The atmospheric effervescence of the Banda
Oriental will enter into the case. There will be
shouting, vociferation and not a little abuse. Not
until a fair exchange of all this has been bandied
to and fro will come the flash of steel or flame&mdash;and
the red stain upon the grasses of the
Campo.</p>

<p>"That these dwellers upon the downlands
should prove themselves born fighters is no matter
for surprise. For the dusky side of their ancestry
they claim the Charrúa Indians, the fiercest and
most warlike of all the tribes in the neighbouring
provinces. With this strain added to the blood
of the old Spaniards, and the mixture fostered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and nourished by the breezy hills, the result has
been a being whose keen sense of dignity and
honour were ever in the very active custody of
knife or lance." But let us change the scene.</p>

<p>"The first two hundred miles of the Uruguay
represent a particularly noble highway of waters,
far broader and more imposing, indeed, than the
equivalent stretch of the Paraná. Ocean-going
vessels here penetrate to Paysandú, and beyond
it to the Lemco port of Colón on the Argentine
shore, while the really magnificent steamers of the
River King, Mihanovich, produce their finest specimens
to ply to and fro here. But, as the banks
of the stream contain not only some of the most
fertile lands of the Republic, but much of interest
beyond, it is worth while to follow its course,
beginning at Montevideo itself, which, as a matter
of fact, is somewhat to anticipate the waters of
the true Uruguay.</p>

<p>"By the quayside of the capital are grouped
three or four of the Mihanovich craft, large, two-funnelled
vessels with an imposing array of decks
surmounted by an unusually spacious promenade
that crowns the whole. One of these is bound
for Salto&mdash;or rather for the Argentine town of
Concordia that lies opposite that port&mdash;but just
now it is not advisable to be tied hard and fast
to her broad decks, since she must call at Buenos
Ayres on her way, and at many other spots outside
Uruguay and the scope of this book.</p>

<p>"We will therefore perform the strange feat of
making a break in the trip ere it is begun. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
any case, it is necessary to leave the quay over
whose broad, paved surface of reclaimed land the
cabs are rattling, and where the policeman and
porters stand, and where, moreover, a strong group
of Salvationists are singing lustily, surrounded by
a motley but attentive group such as the precincts
of a port attract. But the graceful <em>Triton</em> shall
churn her way out into the open without us, since
we will cling so far as possible to the Uruguayan
shore, forging upwards through the yellowing
waters, to halt at Sauce with its willow-covered
lands and Colonia with its rocky beach, until
Carmelo is passed, and at Nueva Palmira the
River Uruguay has been fairly entered. Even
then, however, it is necessary to accept the
fact more or less on trust, and to confide in the
accuracy of the map rather than in that of the eyesight.
For the faint line that has recently
appeared on the horizon to the left might as well
stand for a distant streak upon the waters as
for the low-lying Argentine shore that it actually
represents.</p>

<p>"To the right, the Uruguayan bank is well
defined. Here the undulations of the land swell
boldly out from the edge of the river, while in
many places rocks and boulders strew the sloping
foreshore as though to accentuate the frontier
between stream and land that is so faintly defined
upon the opposite coast. Here and there the
verdure of the hills is broken by the darker green
bands of the eucalyptus plantations, through which
from time to time gleam the white walls of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
estancia-house. At intervals the chimneys of a
saladero prick upwards from the nearer neighbourhood
of the bank. About these centres of their
doom the speck-like figures of the cattle dot the
surrounding pastures, grazing in fortunate ignorance
of their end.</p>

<p>"The traffic upon the river itself is by no
means inconsiderable. Native topsail schooners
laden with jerked beef, fruit and timber come
gliding serenely down the stream beneath their
spread of sail. One of these craft is especially
indicative of the main industry of the land. The
vessel is laden as high as the booms will permit
with horns of cattle, the bleaching mounds of
which must represent the sacrifice of many thousands
of animals. There are smart Government
tugs, too, that hold the official guardians of the
mighty stream, and great dredgers of queer and
monstrous shape that steam slowly along to find
an anchorage where the bottom is shallow, and
there remorselessly to bite out mouthfuls from the
unduly lofty bed.</p>

<p>"At rarer intervals appear the ocean-going craft
and sailing vessels. It would be safe to wager
that there is not one of those passing downstream
that is not laden with some portions or other of
the bodies bequeathed to humanity by the unconsulted
yet generous bovine souls. Nevertheless,
the exact species of cargo would be more difficult
to predict. It might be beef itself, or hides that
will make leather upon which to sit while consuming
the meat, or horns which will provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
handles for the necessary complement of knives, or
indeed many other products useful for similar purposes.
There never was such a creature as the ox
for the provision of a variety of articles that all
eloquently urge the benefit of his death!</p>

<p>"A tall and majestic structure has come into
sight from round a bend in the stream now, and is
sweeping rapidly downwards. With grey hull,
white upper-works about her rows of decks, and
twin black funnels to cap the whole, she is one
of the proud fleet of steamers that ply throughout
the entire system of the great rivers. If the vessel
upon which you may be found bears a corresponding
<span style="vertical-align:-0.1em; font-weight:bold; font-family:sans-serif; font-size:1.2em">M</span> upon its funnel&mdash;which in the case of a
passenger craft may be taken as a practical certainty&mdash;you
may be assured that you will not be
passed without recognition, even if sheltered by
a mere paltry stern-wheeler that is bound for one
of the small tributary streams. Combining
affability with size, the whale will blow out three
deep roars of salute from its great horn, that will
be echoed by a like number of shrill notes from
the treble whistle of the minnow. Such is the
etiquette throughout the entire length of the rivers.
The six blows are sounding throughout the day
from the Tropics of Brazil downwards to where
the La Plata and the ocean meet.</p>

<p>"Upon the right-hand side Fray Bentos has
come into view, marked in the first place by a
great collection of tall black chimneys glistening
in the sun. Beneath is verdure and massive
white buildings and streets of dwelling-houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
while to the front is the Lemco port with a small
forest of masts rising from its waters. The
place, in a double sense, represents the very incarnation
of Uruguay's trade. A greedy spot that
swallows live cattle by tens of thousands to render
them up again in the pathetically diminished form
of extract! Even now the odour of soup floats
heavily in the air from across a mile of water&mdash;a
proof that Fray Bentos is busily occupied in turning
out its brown rivers of fluid.</p>

<p>"The factory, the most notable in the country,
is indeed strongly symbolical of the land where
starvation in ordinary circumstances of peace has
never yet been known. Havana may be the
paradise of the smoker, Epernay that of the
champagne lover; but the eater's heaven is
undoubtedly situated in Uruguay, a paradise in
which the spirits of departed and honest butchers
might well revel in perfect joy.</p>

<p>"Just above Fray Bentos the islands dot the
river more plentifully than in almost any other
part of the great stream. As is the case on the
Paraná, it is difficult enough at times to distinguish
between these and the true bank on the
Argentine shore; both are equally lowly and each
covered with the same density of willows and
native scrub. Amongst these larger islands,
however, whose surface may comprise several
square miles, are numerous smaller pieces of land,
and some quite diminutive specimens that can lay
claim to no more than a few yards of area.
These are baby islands&mdash;young territories that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
only just succeeded in raising their heads above
water. For an island here is conceived, grows
and dies in a fashion that is vegetable rather than
purely earthy. The fact is not really curious,
seeing that vegetation is directly concerned in their
birth.</p>

<p>"The conception of one of these is evident even
now. A tangle of the thick leaves of the
camelota&mdash;the water plant with its mauve hyacinth-like
flower&mdash;has in its downward floating course
fouled the earth of a shallow in mid-stream. The
arrested clump of green has already inveigled
other objects to keep it company in its trap. A
few sticks and branches and tufts of grass are
already fast in the embrace of the powerful stems
and green leaves, while at the end that faces the
stream the water-driven sand has risen at the
obstacle, and has shyly protruded a small round
hump or two above the ripples. The life of the
thing is as uncertain as that of a seedling or of a
human child. Under favourable conditions it will
grow and solidify year by year until from the
few leaves and sticks will have extended some
square miles of tree-covered soil. On the other
hand, it may be swept remorselessly away in its
earliest days ere the tentative formation has had
time to secure sufficiently firm hold of the earth.</p>

<p>"In any case the life of these islands is comparatively
short, and fresh floods and currents are
forming some and destroying others all the while.
During these periods of flood many of them would
seem possessed of the characteristics of icebergs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Detached by the irresistible force of the currents,
great fragments of the vegetation and camelota-plant
that cling to their sides go swirling down the
stream. Though they can boast no polar bears,
they are occasionally freighted with other beasts
whose neighbourhood is equally undesirable. On
such occasions snakes and many four-footed specimens
of northern creatures form the unwilling
tenants of these frail rafts of vegetation. It is
said that many years ago one of unusually large
size struck the shore of Montevideo itself, disgorging
four jaguars, who entered the town
as much to their own terror as to that of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>"With Fray Bentos once left in the rear, the
river becomes distinctly narrowed, and, where no
islands intervene, the features of either bank begin
to be clearly distinguished at the same time. The
Argentine shore has broken away from its dead
level now, and is rising in gentle undulations; the
Uruguayan coast, too, as though in a determined
endeavour to retain its physical superiority, has
taken to heap itself in far loftier and more imposing
hills than before.</p>

<p>"The next town of importance at which the
steamer halts is that of Paysandú, the great centre
of ox-tongues. Indeed, were one to adopt the
popular figurative methods of certain magazines,
amazing results might well be extracted from the
commerce of the place. Thus, supposing a year's
accumulation of Paysandú ox-tongues were able
jointly to give forth the notes that they were wont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to render in life, the effect of the combined roar
would probably be to deafen the entire populace
of the Republic, and to blow every atom of water
from the river! The number of men they would
feed, and the distance they would cover if extended
in a line I do not know; but it may be
taken for granted that the export of these preserved
instruments of bovine speech is very
considerable.</p>

<p>"Paysandú ranks as the second commercial city
in the Republic. It is true that, so far as size
is concerned, it is altogether dwarfed by Montevideo,
since the inhabitants of the smaller town
number only twenty thousand or so. Yet, the
centre of a rich pastoral and agricultural province,
the place is of no little commercial importance,
and, although its architecture remains largely of
the pleasant but old-fashioned Spanish style, not
a few new buildings and boulevards have already
sprung into existence. Like the majority of towns
of its kind, it is well equipped with electric lighting,
telephones and other such modern appliances,
although its tramcar traction is still effected by the
humbler methods of the horse.</p>

<p>"To the north of Paysandú the stream narrows,
the islands become few and far between, and the
course of the river is distinct and well-defined.
The landscape, too, is more varied now than that
of the lower reaches. Among the Uruguayan
rounded hills, a few well-marked tablelands spread
their broad, level surfaces in the way that is
characteristic of so many parts of the Republic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Both the inland valleys and river banks are
covered with an added density of vegetation, while
beaches of shining white sand jut out at intervals
from the shore. As for the Argentine bank, it
has quite suddenly assumed a marked individuality
of its own. It is covered with a reddish yellow
rolling soil, tinged only lightly with green, from
which close groves of palm-trees sprout upwards
for mile after mile. It is as though a portion
of Africa on the one shore were facing a rather
wooded and broken portion of the South Downs
on the other!</p>

<p>"The water itself has been growing more limpid
all the while, now that the dead-flat, soft alluvial
soil of the Argentine bank has given way to a
harder and more stony surface. It has become
shallow in parts, too, and the nose of the steamer
often gives a tentative turn to the right or left
as she cautiously feels her way. The craft has
penetrated almost to the limits of the lower stretch
of the great river now, and the rising bed is a
premonitory symptom of the end.</p>

<p>"On the right has now risen the loftiest bluff
that has yet marked the Uruguayan shore. It
forms one of the walls of a striking and bold
tableland. The place is now known as the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mesa
de Artigas</i>&mdash;the table of Artigas. It was upon
the summit of this hill that the Uruguayan
national hero had his chief encampment, and it
has been described as a desolate and lonely spot,
haunted by murdered spirits and by the memory
of horrors, that no living being cared to approach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
The description cannot be said to hold good at
the present moment. The green slopes are dotted
with grazing cattle and sheep, while at one point
the distant figures of two mounted Gauchos are
careering to and fro, and the cattle in the neighbourhood
are wheeling together and lumbering
forward as a result of their man&oelig;uvres."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Uruguay is known as the Oriental Republic,
from its position on the eastern side of the river&mdash;the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Banda Oriental</i>&mdash;and it was formerly part
of Argentina, but became separated in 1828, after
revolutionary war, brought to an end through the
mediation of Great Britain, which declared it a
free and independent State.</p>

<p>The towns of Paysandú and Salto, which the
steamer reaches on the Uruguay River, are at the
head of low-water navigation. Paysandú has its
tale of political savagery to tell, when its gallant
defender, Leandro Gomez and his companions,
were butchered in cold blood, after bombardment
of the place by Brazilian forces. It has suffered
much from revolution.</p>

<p>Both these towns are famous for the exports
from their <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">saladeros</i>, or meat-curing establishments.
Beyond Salto lies a rich grazing country,
on whose undulating hills fat herds of cattle
subsist. And indeed we are here in some of the
richest stock-raising land of South America,
bordering on similar districts in Southern Brazil,
whose frontier lies not far to the north. Both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
towns are laid out with modern conveniences and
public institutions. Between them navigation has
its risks from rocks and shoals, and above Salto
continuous navigation is not possible, as before
remarked.</p>

<p>The Uruguay River forms in its higher reaches
the eastern boundary of the Misionès province, a
curious enclave belonging to Argentina, thrust in
between Paraguay and Brazil; a region of sad
memories, perpetuated in its name and in the lifeless
villages along the banks of the Paraná and
Uruguay Rivers. It was the land of the Missions
of the Jesuit fathers, with their terrible and melancholy
history, at which we shall presently cast a
glance. First, however, we must do justice to
the great land of Argentina.</p>

<h2><span class="headersmallfont">CHAPTER XIV</span><br />
<span class="headerlargefont">THE RIVER PLATE AND THE PAMPAS</span><br />
<span class="headersmallfont">ARGENTINA, URUGUAY AND PARAGUAY</span></h2>

<p>Of comparatively recent times there has arisen,
in the temperate zone of South America, facing
upon the Atlantic seaboard, a city which has
rapidly become a centre of great wealth and an
emporium of world trade, with a population greater
than that of any other metropolis of Latin America,
and with an ebb and flow of modern life and
activity such as we have been prone to associate
with the Anglo-Saxon rather than the Spanish
development of American civilization.</p>

<p>Such is this city of Buenos Ayres, which we
now approach; the capital of the huge territory
of the Republic of Argentina, which, having its
northern boundary above the Tropic of Capricorn,
extends for two thousand miles towards the frigid
region above Cape Horn.</p>

<p>It is with no feelings of envy that we call to
mind the fact that this enormous and potential
region might have formed part of the British
Empire; a Canada in South America. For such
might have been its destiny if General Beresford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
in 1806, had not been forced to surrender, after
obtaining possession of Buenos Ayres, and if
General Whitelocke, later, had not been forced to
capitulate before the organized opposition of the
colonists, when Spain and France were pitted
against Great Britain.</p>

<p>The Republic of Argentina is a country so enormous
and diversified that to attempt here to give
anything but the merest descriptive outlines would
be futile. But let us endeavour to obtain at least
a slight idea of its form and configuration.</p>

<p>We shall bear in mind that the country consists
broadly of four topographical divisions. First is
the land of the Pampas, at which we have already
glanced. Second we may speak of the great
plains and broken, and in part forested, deserts,
of what is termed the Gran Chaco, forming that
curious northern, undeveloped part of Argentina,
bounded by Paraguay on the one hand and the
Bolivian Andes on the other. Third we have
the broken Andine region, abutting upon Bolivia
and running south to the frontiers of Chile.
Fourth is the vast territory of Patagonia, with the
Chilean Andes on its west; a region occupying all
the great narrowing part of the continent to the
frigid south.</p>

<p>Argentina, as it is known to travel, commerce
and history, is the Argentina of the Pampa.
Herein lies its civilization, its great towns, its
railway network, the things by which it lives.</p>

<p>The Pampa is a vast storehouse of food, and in
some respects it does not lack beauty. Much of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
is a dead level, but it has its elevations (both
materially and metaphorically). It has, too, its
great scourges of Nature, in the droughts which
at times have ruined its industries, and which must
inevitably have their periods of visitation; in the
other plagues, as of the devastating locust, for
which doubtless science will produce remedy or
extirpation. The tempestuous winds which blow
across it are at times another scourge, and the dust
storms may often cause the dweller to ask whether
the plagues of Egypt shall still be visited upon it!
As to the droughts, we do not know if these are
not extending, just as it may be that the snowfields
of the Andes are diminishing, as if threatening
some slow drying-up of the fountains of
heaven here.</p>

<p>The early folk of these great plains were not
of a meek and humble character, such as the
Spaniards so often encountered. They were <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Indios
bravos</i>; fighters and stubborn savages, implacably
hostile. Nevertheless, they gave way in time, as
destiny had decreed they should.</p>

<div id="Fig_204" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">THE PAMPAS, ARGENTINA.<br /><p class="marginrightspaced">Vol. II. To face p. 204.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the things of the animal world, in its
commercial sense, might be taken as most remarkable
here. From few mares and stallions brought
in by the men of Spain, vast equine droves, half
wild, appeared with marvellous rapidity, and the
later breeds multiplied similarly. It was a horseless
land before the white man came. To-day a
horseman pursuing his way over the vast plain
is a very prominent object against the skyline.
There was no ox or cow, but to-day the teeming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
herds in their millions&mdash;though not unnumbered&mdash;have
built, through commerce, through the products
of their hides and bodies, the palaces and
boulevards of Buenos Ayres and its sister cities,
the homes of the millionaires of this new American
nation; a land where the progenitors of both man
and beast first humbly crossed from old Europe,
and now pour forth their riches thereto.</p>

<p>How far this wealth shall still increase we do
not know. It may be that the limit of the pastoral
industry in the Argentine Pampas has been reached
or approached. The herds do not now greatly
increase, since their census in 1908, of nearly
thirty million head of cattle. Nature and man
both take a heavy toll, the one in adverse climatic
conditions, the other in waste and carelessness, as
if the prodigality of the fruits of the earth were
inexhaustible. On the great ranges, the cattle
exist almost automatically, bearing the scorching
sun or piercing wind; and in the droughts, as we
pass thereover, the vision will be shocked by a
lamentable spectacle of dying or rotting cattle on
every hand. They are too numerous; they
cannot be fed or watered, or buried when they
succumb. Dust, flies and mummified bodies around
offend the traveller here, and it is doubtful if man
has a right to bring to being animals in such profusion
that Nature cannot support them.</p>

<p>Possibly, in the future, better quality and lesser
quantity will be the methods forced upon the cattle
owners here. There is, too, a tendency towards
smaller cattle ranges and perhaps more "intensive"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
methods, and what may be called "cattle
feudalism" may beneficially suffer some modification.
Irrigation, again, brings about a more varied
production.</p>

<p>Cold storage and the making of meat extracts
are, of course, one of the primary features of the
cattle industry.</p>

<p>The enormous wheat-plains are the next source
of wealth here, and other lands have cause to be
grateful for both the wheat and the meat of
Argentina. But the yield is comparatively low,
being but twelve to thirteen bushels to the acre,
for methods of cultivation are often crude.</p>

<p>The Argentine farmer is greatly dependent upon
his wheat and maize, and if his cereal crop fails
he has few resources to tide him over the bad
time. The resources of Argentina in cereals are
very great, and it has been calculated that there
are 175 million acres of land available for their
cultivation. Argentina provides a great part of
the world's supply of maize, perhaps half, but in
times of drought this falls very seriously.</p>

<div id="Fig_206" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">THE CITY OF CORDOBA, ARGENTINA.<br /><p class="marginrightspaced">Vol. II. To face p. 206.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Social conditions on the Pampa will doubtless
become modified in the future. There is too great a
contrast&mdash;for a democratic or republican country&mdash;in
the palatial home of the rich <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">estanciero</i> and those
of the labourer. Again, the arriving immigrant,
upon whom Argentina is so much dependent for
labour, being unable often to obtain land for himself
in this enormous country, emigrates again, and
during some years half of their numbers go away
elsewhere. It would seem that the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
is awake to this condition, although the remedy
is slow.</p>

<p>The great plains of the Chaco may, in the future,
bring to being another important branch of agriculture,
in the growing of cotton, an industry
already successfully implanted in this often fertile
belt, whose rich black soils have been likened to
those of the Mississippi Valley. This region might
add much to the world's wealth in cotton production,
but here again the question of labour is
paramount.</p>

<p>But let us take our further way across these
oceans of the Pampa, until the far line of the
Andes rises on our horizon.</p>

<p>We may leave Buenos Ayres early and reach
Rosario in the afternoon, the train making its way
over a country flat as a table, with fields of wheat
or maize, or pasture lands; with here and there a
white-washed house and a few trees around it:
trees of that variety which the all-devouring locust
will not attack, for such a species there is. Perhaps
the locusts are upon us, swarming in at the
window of the carriage, where the native traveller
crushes them vindictively. They may be as thick
in the air as the flakes of a snowstorm.</p>

<p>On the farms, one method of getting rid of the
locusts is by creating an infernal din by the beating
of pots and pans, when they retreat to the
lands of a neighbor! Where do they come from?
The Gran Chaco has been accused of being their
breeding-ground and point of departure, but whatever
their origin, they are a veritable destructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
plague, destroying perhaps in a few hours wide
areas of smiling crops and fruitful gardens.</p>

<p>We reach Mendoza, beautifully situated, and
watered by streams which flow from the Andes,
giving life to many a fruitful sugar-cane plantation
and vineyard, where under irrigation scientifically
practised, from dams and conduits, the fertile
soil yields up wealth in its most delightful forms,
wealth of sugar, of wine, of deep pastures of
alfalfa. Here, indeed, is the California of Argentina,
on the slopes of the Andes, with Mendoza as
its pleasing metropolis.</p>

<p>To the north lies Tucuman, famous in still
greater degree for its production of sugar, with
over thirty factories making sugar and alcohol,
and yielding great wealth to their owners.</p>

<p>Here, however, if we are disposed to be critical,
we shall point to the unlovely barracks of the
labourers who are instrumental in producing this
wealth. In Argentina, unfortunately, agricultural
labour is little protected by the law, and contrasts
are often painful. However, the climate at
least is kind.</p>

<p>Leaving this region we shall traverse belts of
dusty wilderness, which constitute part of Argentina&mdash;deserts
that extend to the Andes. In
this, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Arabia Deserta</i> of South America,
caravans in olden times, in the Colonial period,
often perished and left no trace. The thirst, the
dust, the savage Indian, swallowed them up. Spain
ordered that all trade should pass this way, through
Tucuman and Salta, the route from Peru. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
in the town hall of Tucuman town that Independence
from Spain was first pronounced.</p>

<p>The railway system in this part of South
America pushes its conquering path westwards,
and through Juyjuy&mdash;a name of difficult pronunciation
for the uninitiated<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>&mdash;and beyond we may
reach the railways of Bolivia, and so the Andes.</p>

<p>But the great thoroughfare of travel is the
Trans-Andine Railway, a monumental work of
the engineer, which, after many delays, pierced the
Andes and gave means of access to Chile and the
Pacific coast. We may have reached Rosario by
the great highway of the river. The city is the
outlet to a rich productive region, and stands on
the eastern margin of the great Pampas. Rosario
is, in the main, a commercial centre, whence many
products of Northern Argentina are embarked on
the full-flowing Paraná which washes its quays.
Sacks of wheat, bales of hay, cattle and all their
products, bags of sugar, maize in large quantities,
and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quebracho</i> extract, are the principal of these
exports. It reflects, or indeed in part gives rise
to, the activities of Buenos Ayres, to which it
comes second in importance as regards size and
commerce.</p>

<p>Upon the site of Rosario, until the middle of
last century, but a small village stood, founded in
1730, where now the straight cross-streets, in
chess-board regularity, of the modern town are
laid out, together with a handsome boulevard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>lined with residences, pleasingly interspersed with
turf and trees, and many public buildings.</p>

<p>Paraná, which we reach in our further voyage
upstream, is also classed as a seaport, notwithstanding
that it is more than 600 miles from the
open sea. Yonder ferry boats gives access to
Santa Fé, on the opposite side of the river, a
town of more ancient character, founded by the
Spanish in 1573 as a halting-place on the voyage
to Asuncion.</p>

<p>Paraná stands well above and some distance
from the river, and is the capital of the rich province
of Entre Rios, over whose territory the agriculturist
or economist may well cast a satisfactory
glance. The name of this province in English signifies
"between the rivers"; descriptive of the
region bounded on the one side by the waterway
we have ascended, and on the other by the
Uruguay River. This is the "Mesopotamia" of
Argentina, otherwise known as the "garden of
Argentina," from its well-watered and fertile
nature, its pastoral and agricultural occupations,
its products of fruits and corn, its woods and its
mild and healthy climate. Had this province
devoted more energy to its better development
materially and morally, and less to political conflict
and revolutionary strife, its picturesque designation
would be more amply justified, but it has
ever been one of the most turbulent districts in
the Argentine confederation. Now, its prosperity
has resulted in more settled conditions.</p>

</div>

<p>Our way now lies still farther up this great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
waterway, to the romantic land of Paraguay, for
such this inland country has often been designated.</p>

<p>We have already seen that Asuncion is reached
by steamer, and this was, indeed, until a few years
ago, when the railway was built, with a train-ferry,
the only means of reaching the Paraguayan
capital.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He who can afford time for an up-river
journey from Buenos Ayres to Asuncion will find
the experience as instructive as anything else of
the kind throughout South America. It is true
that the flat pastures which go to make up the
earlier stretches of the landscape lack a good deal
from the picturesque point of view. But it is this
very distribution of the scenery which adds to the
charm of the trip, for, as the sub-tropical regions
begin to exert their influence, and as the banks
approach each other more nearly, the charm of
the surroundings increases steadily.</p>

<p>"After a certain point has been reached there
are very few hours or dozens of miles which are
not productive of some new feature or other to
captivate the eye of the traveller. But not until
that famous wheat centre, the Argentine town of
Rosario, has been reached does this phase of the
journey begin. There for the first time the flat,
reed-covered banks of the river fall away, to give
place to definite <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">barrancas</i>, or cliffs, that boldly
mark the edge of the great stream. When the
grain-shoots and line of moored steamers that mark
this thriving town have been passed, the sandstone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
cliff continues at intervals on alternate banks; the
vivid scarlet of the ceibo-tree becomes more frequent;
and the clumps of camelota, the floating
water hyacinth, tend to increase in size. The districts,
moreover, are obeying one of the primal
laws of the world in that, as the blossoms, birds
and butterflies increase in brilliancy, so does the
human complexion tend to grow duskier. But
here this applies only to the humbler people on
the banks and to the fisherfolk and watermen who
sit in their crude dugout canoes. The more important
persons continue white-skinned, the sole
distinction between them and their brethren of the
lower reaches of the river being that they now
begin to form the aristocracy of the land instead
of standing as the mere representatives of the
wealthier classes.</p>

<p>"When the roofs and parks and gardens of
Paraná have been passed and the buildings of
Colastiné, the river port of Santa Fé, have been
left behind, the warmer airs already give a foretaste
of what is to come farther to the north. All
this time the vegetation has been increasing on
the banks. The wide stretches of open, treeless
pastures have long ago fallen away. The country
where the cattle graze is now pleasantly interspersed
with clumps of indigenous trees, and the line of
the banks is obscured in parts by dense clusters of
verdure, in which the palms begin to occupy a
more and more important space.</p>

<p>"Presently on the right bank of the river, and
thus to the left of the steamer's bow, appears that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
curious low-lying country of the Chaco, the alternate
forests, swamps and pastures that extend
from here northwards through the entire length of
Paraguay and well into Bolivia on the other side.
There are orchids hanging up aloft among the
foliage now, and doubtless a monkey or two among
the denser clumps of woodland. But these pioneer
creatures of the Tropics to the north are rare
enough here, and in any case are invisible. Their
presence thus is generally unsuspected by the newcomer,
which is not the case with the mosquitoes
and those clouds of other <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bichos</i>, whose numbers
increase in the most amazing fashion with almost
every hour that goes by.</p>

<p>"Indeed, did one judge of the winged pests of
these neighbourhoods by the myriads which abound
above the fervid waters, the outlook would be
sufficiently unpromising even to the most mosquito-hardened
of men. The song of this plague is
continuous of an evening now, and when the daylight
has vanished in the abrupt fashion in which
it is wont to fade away in these latitudes, the
electric globes of the steamer are all but obscured
by the insects that dance about them so thickly
as to resemble dense clouds of smoke that roll
in confused masses about a half-seen flame!
Fortunately, these river reaches&mdash;most beloved of
all the haunts of the winged creatures&mdash;do not
afford a fair and moderate sample of the insect
life of these latitudes, quite considerable enough
though the usual run of this is wont to be.</p>

<p>"Arrived at the Argentine town of Corrientes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
one of the most important strategic spots in the
whole river system has been reached. To one
bound upstream this is the parting of the river
ways. A few miles to the north of the town the
choice is open to the traveller whether he will turn
to the right and ascend the waters of the Alto
Paraná, with Argentina on his right hand and
Paraguay on his left, or whether he will keep
straight on to the north and reverse this territorial
situation, having Argentina on his left and
Paraguay on his right.</p>

<p>"The main line of the waters, with Asuncion as
its object, lies straight to the north, and almost
immediately after leaving Corrientes the steamer
has entered the Paraguay River. It is at this point
that the somewhat curious nomenclature of the
various streams becomes most evident. It is the
remarkable fate of the Paraguayan when bound
from his home to the Atlantic Ocean to have to
descend three different rivers, or, if you prefer it,
various stretches of the same river known by three
different names. From the point of view of fluvial
equity, there is no doubt that considerable wrong
has been done to the River Paraguay in the way
of nomenclature. Why this splendid navigable
stream, at its junction with the cascade-broken
and far shorter Alto Paraná, should yield its name
to that of the lesser current, and should continue
to flow southwards as the Paraná, is a sufficiently
incomprehensible matter to most geographers. And
then, when it has all but run its course, the river
performs a second wedding, with the Uruguay this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
time, and again changes its name. But on this
occasion neither stream obtains the advantage over
the other, for both roll their few remaining miles
to the sea under the entirely fresh name of La
Plata. Nevertheless, there does not seem to be a
doubt that, from the point of view of importance,
the name of the great stream which rises to
the north of the inland Republic should be the
Paraguay for its entire course as far as the
ocean.</p>

</div>

<p>"This digression, however, has led us away from
the upstream journey to Asuncion. Once in the
Paraguay River, the beauties of the scene would
seem to have become more marked. The banks
have drawn sufficiently near to each other for
their increasing charms to become plain. No
longer does the steamer steer a tortuous course
through a maze of low and reedy islands that
never permit the stranger to be certain whether
he is gazing on the mainland or whether further
channels at the bank lie between him and the
actual shore.</p>

<p>"Now the banks of the stream, with their
flower-starred vegetation, are plainly defined. Once
to the north of the mouth of the Bermejo tributary,
moreover, which pours its amazingly red and
muddy waters into the main stream, the river has
become comparatively limpid. Alligators had
already made their appearance in the Paraná; but
such banks of sand and mud as emerge here and
there from the waters of the Paraguay are far
more thickly covered with the sluggish bodies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the small saurians, that in these latitudes seldom
exceed six or seven feet.</p>

<p>"Presently, as the steamer drops her anchor
before a port to her right, there is a significant
touch of colour about the small official boat which
puts out to her from the shore. Hitherto the light
blue and white of Argentina has flown at the stern
of these craft. But from this one for the first
time floats the red, white, and blue of Paraguay.
The steamer has arrived at Humaitá, the first port
of the inland Republic."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A massive, stark ruin, standing up on the bank
of the river, the church of Humaitá, carries us
into the history of the dreadful war which laid the
land desolate here, and to which we must shortly
refer. Continuing for the present our way upstream,
the view extends over tobacco and sugar-cane
fields, interspersed with luxuriant banana
groves. Reed huts cluster here and there near
the bank, and groups of dark-skinned workers are
seen. On the opposite shore a fringe of dense
vegetation hides the Chaco plains&mdash;the haunt of
the savage Indian and the tapir, but marked by
occasional clearings. Rafts of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quelracho</i> timber
float down the stream, the heavy wood buoyed
up by trunks of a lighter kind, for the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quelracho</i>
does not float. Soon we reach the mouth of the
Pilcomayo, with its low bank, and then the roofs
and spires of Asuncion come into the field of
view, the salient points of a city that spreads itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
over the rolling ground, surrounded by pleasant
verdure.</p>

<p>Asuncion is to be regarded as a picturesque
city. There is a wealth of flower, which often
covers the hovels on the outskirts. The city is
built partly on its hills and partly on the sandy
riverine plain, and contains some interesting buildings.
Life here is generally simple, and has
certain attractions by reason of this simplicity. It
is nigh upon the tropic zone, but its environment
is such that the climate is pleasant indeed, and,
in fact, has been enthusiastically described by some
as "containing all the elements of perfection."</p>

<p>Asuncion was long the seat of Spanish rule,
which extended over this vast region of river and
forest, and here, among other phases, the bitter
struggle between the Church and the Jesuits was
played out.</p>

<p>Life, we have said, is simple, even for the upper
class, although in its way typical of Spanish
American culture. In humbler circles, clothing
is simple. A cotton chemise is a sufficient garment
for a woman, and perhaps a white <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">manta</i> round
the head, in the fashion brought by Spain from
the Moors; whilst her husband wears nothing
more than a loose shirt and trousers&mdash;clothing that
costs little and lasts long.</p>

<p>These sartorial conditions refer to the Indian
folk who, however, constitute the bulk of the
nation. Upper-class people, of course, wear boots
and shoes, and would indignantly refute any
aspersion as to being backward in the refinements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
life. There are some good buildings in Asuncion,
showing the customary Spanish American ideas
in civic architecture. The most prominent edifice
is a bank, built originally as a palace by the
younger Lopez, and there is a national college
and a public library, but educational progress is
slow in Paraguay. The principal streets are paved,
and lighted with gas and electricity, and there are
street cars and telephones.</p>

<p>The name of Lopez brings forward one of the
most dreadful periods of history in this part of
South America, upon which we may well pause a
space.</p>

<p>Francisco Solano Lopez, dictator of Paraguay,
and self-styled "Protector of the equilibrium of
the La Plata," forced his country into war against
Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, who, aggrieved,
combined for the purpose of suppressing him,
"until no elements of war should be left in Paraguay,"
as their declaration ran. The country was
invaded, the war lasted five years, 1865 to 1870;
a struggle involving enormous sacrifice of blood and
treasure, closing only when the Paraguayans were
practically annihilated. During the struggle every
male Paraguayan was forced to bear arms; there
were regiments of boys from twelve to fifteen years
old; women were used as beasts of burden to
carry ammunition and stores, and were murdered
or left to die by the wayside when their strength
gave out. From a population of nearly one and a
half million, that of Paraguay fell as a consequence
of the struggle to a quarter of a million.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
It is recorded that, in the retreat, Lopez ordered
every town and village to be destroyed and every
living animal slaughtered. Imagining a conspiracy
against his life, this half-crazed dictator, it is
recorded, ordered hundreds of the foremost citizens
of Paraguay to be seized and executed,
including his own brother and brothers-in-law,
judges, cabinet ministers, officers, bishops, two
hundred foreigners and several diplomatic representatives
of the legations. The end of this
extraordinary specimen of a Spanish American
ruler was death in the river, for, having been
reduced to a handful of adherents, on the northern
frontier of Paraguay, he was surprised by
Brazilians, and shot, as he endeavoured to swim
the stream.</p>

<p>Leaving these dreadful reminiscences of civilized
savagery, however, let us take our way through the
Republic. Much of it is extremely fertile; rich
soil abounding in meadows and pastures, with such
varied products as might make of this portion of
the continent a veritable garden or orchard. Our
eyes rest on groves of orange-trees, clustering with
golden fruit, on fields of waving sugar-cane of
immense growth, on vineyards and tobacco fields,
on cotton and hemp plantations. So prolific are
the citrus fruits that hogs are sometimes fattened
on oranges. Millions of dozens of the fruit are
exported down the river to the large towns on its
banks.</p>

<p>The principal product, however, is the well-known
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">yerba maté</i>, or Paraguayan tea, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
growing and collecting of this gives occupation to
the Indian peasants whom we see clustered in the
fields or simple villages. The cost of production
of this article is small, and, exported to Argentina,
Brazil and Chile, the leaf takes the place to some
extent in those communities of tea and coffee.
The leaves of the shrub, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ilèx Paraguayensis</i>,
are stripped, sun-dried and packed in sacks for
export.</p>

<p>This tea could be sold in England at perhaps
sixpence per pound, but, notwithstanding its useful
qualities, it is almost unknown in Britain.</p>

<p>Paraguay is a land where soil and climate lends
itself well to stock-raising, and doubtless this
industry in the future will be much more
extensively cultivated in the Republic, in view of
the world's needs for the products it yields.
Natural pasture is abundant, shelter is unnecessary,
but drought at times is a source of loss. The
breed of the cattle, too, calls for improvement.
The great South American meat and meat-extract
companies have already cast eyes on the possibilities
of the Paraguayan pastures.</p>

</div>

<p>If we are students of social science, we may
recollect that this land we are momentarily treading
was the scene of an interesting experiment in
communism, when, some twenty-five years ago,
William Lane and his companions, of Sydney,
founded their colony of "New Australia." This
little band of Australians, who at least had the
courage of their convictions, suffered endless misfortunes
in their endeavour to demonstrate their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
economic theories, in which there was to be neither
master nor servant, nor rich nor poor, but each
for all. Before starting, their individual possessions
were made over to the common fund. The
Government of Paraguay treated the enterprise
exceedingly well, granted them a tract of extremely
fertile land, which, however, was in a remote spot,
and helped them in various ways, believing, as
did the band of Australians, that success would
attend their endeavours. But at length disillusionment
arose, and although the leader and a few of
his adherents struggled bravely on, disaster befel
the settlement, which lapsed finally into purely
individualistic methods.</p>

<p>A far earlier "socialistic" system flourished in
this part of South America. The story of the
Jesuit missions is one of great interest, but with a
sad ending, and we may cast a glance at it here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was in 1588 that the first Jesuits arrived in
Paraguay, where they met with a warm welcome
at the hands of the colonists, between whom and
the missionary Fathers a bitter feud was eventually
destined to spring up. These early workers made
a cosmopolitan company, counting among their
number Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians and Scots,
besides other nationalities. Setting dauntlessly out
into the forests of Paraguay, they passed from
tribe to tribe, making converts of the Indians in
a fashion sufficiently wholesale to receive some
condemnation at the hands of their detractors.
However much or however little the average
Guaraní may have understood of his actual reception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
into the Christian faith, the perils and hardships
of the early missionaries remained the same,
and these were undoubtedly sufficient to tax the
resolution of any but the most single-hearted
pioneer.</p>

<p>"Little by little, as more Jesuits arrived from
abroad to assist in the work, and as the numbers
of the Guaraní converts grew, began the definite
foundations of that society of the Paraguayan missions
which was feared and hated by those
Spaniards outside its borders who imagined, rightly
or wrongly, that its presence was the cause of much
material wrong to themselves. This country of
the Jesuits had every right to be known as a State.
It administered its own laws and authority, and
was subject to none of the local colonial officials,
a circumstance that undoubtedly gave rise to
numerous outbursts of jealousy. It was, moreover,
rigidly shut off from the outer world, and,
although travellers were permitted to pass, closely
watched, from one of its towns to another, none
but the Jesuit administrators were in the least conversant
with the affairs of the community, and
with the events which were happening in the State.
It is this latter circumstance, of course, which has
been responsible for so many of the disputes concerning
actual facts&mdash;arguments which have arisen
both during the period of the Jesuit dominion and
after the expulsion of the Fathers. But in any
case no dispute has ever arisen concerning the fact
that this land of the Jesuits was a self-governing
State, whether it be known by any of the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
names which have been applied to it&mdash;a republic,
an empire, or a socialistic community pure and
simple.</p>

<p>"The mission country of the Jesuits was situated
amid those delightful tracts of land where the
modern Republics of Paraguay, Brazil and Uruguay
now meet. From north to south it lay,
roughly, between the parallels of 25° and 30°, and
thus it comprised a stretch of territory the open
spaces of which may rightfully be called 'the
Garden of South America.' We may now survey
this spot in the height of its prosperity, beginning
with some aspects of its thirty towns, which, of
course, include some of the most salient features
of all.</p>

<p>"The Jesuits of Paraguay were nothing if not
consistent, and their policy was eloquently shown
in the construction of their towns. None of their
converts, decreed the missionaries, should be permitted
to outdo his, or her, neighbourhood in the
matter of dress and outward appearance. The
priests did their best to ensure equality and the
absence of heartburning by a regulation that every
Indian should be garbed exactly the same, both in
material and cut, as were his brethren and sisters.
This same theory was made to apply in the case of
the dwelling-places of the Guaranís. It has been
remarked that these resembled each other as closely
as one drop of water resembles another. 'The
arrangement of these,' says Alvear, who wrote
from personal experience, 'is so uniform that when
you have seen one you may say that you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
seen them all. Some tiny freak of architecture or
some little touch of private adornment&mdash;that is the
only difference that may be remarked. Essentially
they are all the same, and this has been brought
to such a pitch that those who travel through
them are apt to begin to wonder if they are not
being accompanied by the same enchanted town,
the eyes of a lynx being needed to tell the difference
between the inhabitants and clothes of one of
these places and those of another. The plan of
them all is rectangular, the streets stretching from
north to south and from east to west, and the
Plaza, which is always roomy and level, in the
middle. The church, college and cemetery occupy
that side of the Plaza that faces north.'</p>

<p>"This description affords, at all events, a rough
and general outline of one of the Jesuit towns.
It leaves, however, many details of interest to be
filled in. The aspect of one of these places, it
may be said, was extremely pleasant, the Jesuits
who understood these matters very thoroughly,
having introduced orange-groves and other such
growths with consummate skill among the buildings.
The church would be a most solidly built
edifice, containing three or five naves, as the case
might be. Its interior, moreover, was richly
decorated by the Indian craftsmen and workers in
metal, and here, one imagines, some distinguishing
originality must have occurred, although no doubt
this was avoided as much as possible.</p>

<p>"Attached to the college, which was usually a
very large building, were the workshops and storehouses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of the town, which were thus under the
immediate eye of the Fathers. The buildings in
which the Indians themselves were accommodated
were very extensive but low-roofed structures,
being some sixty yards in length and ten in
breadth. The majority of the buildings were contrived
of great blocks of the locally found <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tacurú</i>
stone, which for the purpose of cutting possesses
the very unusual advantage of being comparatively
soft when first taken from the earth, hardening
little by little as it is exposed to the air. The
magnificent woods of the neighbouring forests
were frequently employed in addition, and the
ubiquitous <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">adobe</i> was made to serve here and
there. All the buildings were very solidly tiled.</p>

<p>"So much for the general description of one of
those Jesuit towns of which only the ruins now
remain, all but swallowed up by the encroaching
verdure of the forest. In their neighbourhood was
nearly always a stone-lined spring, welling out into
a pool planted about with palms, and thus presenting
a most agreeable appearance. Near this
would be the chapels of the 'Stations of the
Cross.'</p>

<p>"Finally, it must be said that many of these
centres which were most exposed to the raids of
the hostile Brazilian inhabitants of San Paolo were
strongly fortified, being surrounded by a deep ditch
and a solid wall of hardened mud.</p>

<p>"Each of these towns was in charge of two
Jesuits, not too large a number, it must be <span id="Fix_225">admitted</span>,
to have control of a town the population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of which was probably about four thousand. These,
however, were assisted by numerous Guaraní
officials, and their management appears to have
been conducted with exemplary smoothness.</p>

<p>"Having now obtained a glimpse of the plan
and aspects of a Jesuit mission town, it is time to
consider some attributes that are at least as important&mdash;its
inhabitants. Proceeding downwards
along its hierarchy from the two Jesuit Fathers in
charge&mdash;who were responsible only to a superior
of their own order who travelled continually to
and fro between the various towns&mdash;we arrive at
the higher Guaraní officials. At the head of these
was a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cacique</i>, who in a sense acted as Governor
of the place, although his office was under the
closest supervision of the two Jesuits in charge.
There were also <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">corregidores</i>, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">regidores</i>, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">alcaldes</i>,
and many other officials, whose posts corresponded
more or less with those held by Spaniards in
the somewhat cumbrous municipal scheme that
obtained in the peninsula.</p>

<p>"In order that the position of these dusky dignitaries
should be properly emphasized they were
raised above the law which decreed perfect equality
of dress for all, and on feast days their uniforms
were wont to be sufficiently gorgeous to distinguish
them from the rest.</p>

<p>"The dress of the rank and file of the inhabitants
was simple to a degree. The material employed
for that of both men and women was white
cotton. The men wore a species of shirt above
short breeches, while the women were dressed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
petticoats, above which was an armless chemise
known as the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">typoi</i>. The hair was plaited into
one or two tails, and was generally adorned with a
crimson flower. To such a degree had this
doctrine of similarity of costume become implanted
into the minds of the Indians that, after the expulsion
of the Jesuits, those who succeeded the missionaries&mdash;and
endeavoured in vain to carry on the
work&mdash;were astonished at the tenacity with which
they clung to it. Desirous of rooting out entirely
the influence of the Jesuits, they assiduously
pointed out to the Indians the advantages of individuality
in dress. But it was a very long time
before one of these could bring himself to distinguish
his person from the rest by means of any
of those added touches which are usually so eagerly
sought after by the dusky races.</p>

<p>"The supposition that Satan finds work for idle
hands to do was acknowledged by the Jesuits with
an enthusiasm on which was founded the principal
tenets of their communities. In the mission towns
any risk of this kind was quite infinitesimal!
Indeed, one of the charges levelled by the opponents
of the missionaries has been to the effect
that they harnessed the Guaranís from the age of
five years upwards to an endless and grinding
routine of toil. Indeed, in estimating the benefits
derived by the company of the Jesuits from this
fount of labour, a very gifted modern Argentine
writer estimates the eighteenth-century Guaraní
population of the Paraguayan missions at some
150,000, adding that, so healthy was the climate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of their country that almost the entire force of
this community was available, invalids being almost
unknown. In this he unconsciously pays a notable
tribute to the methods employed in the 'Reductions'&mdash;by
which name these mission towns were
also known. For this remarkable lack of invalids
may well be compatible with the circumstances
attending ordinary hard work, but they suggest
nothing of that grinding toil such as the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">conquistadores</i>
were only too frequently accustomed to inflict
on the aborigines&mdash;labour involving broken health
and premature death.</p>

<p>"The admittedly healthy condition of the
Jesuitical Guaranís is in itself sufficient to refute
such a charge as this.</p>

<p>"The various kinds of work carried on in the
mission towns were of an amazingly comprehensive
nature. Even their most hostile critics have never
attempted to dispute the administrative abilities
of the missionaries. These found a full opportunity
in the fertile soil and varied products of the
country. One of the first industries they took up
was that of collecting the famous Paraguayan tea,
the yerba maté, from the forests in which it grew.
Undoubtedly this was one of the severest tasks
which the Guaranís had to undertake, since the
yerba-tree, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ilèx Paraguayensis</i>, favours the
denser forests that are the haunt of the jaguar,
the venomous snake and countless noxious insects.
Moreover, as the yerba maté-trees in the neighbourhood
of the settlements became used up, the
journeys of the Indians grew longer and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
difficult, and the return marches, under the burden
of the yerba loads, still more strenuous.</p>

<p>"Another industry which rapidly attained to
great importance was that of cattle-breeding. It
is difficult to picture the Jesuit Fathers galloping
with flying robes after the scampering herds of
cattle, gathering them into <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rodeos</i>, and 'parting'
them after the fashion of the gaucho&mdash;and this
they undoubtedly did not do! At the same time,
it is certain that they must have closely supervised
their dusky herdsmen; for the numbers of their
cattle rapidly increased to an extent which could
only have been possible under an efficient, and
comparatively scientific, management. This will
be evident when it is explained that more than
thirty thousand head of cattle grazed on one of
their estates alone, and that at the time of the
expulsion of the company their pastures were found
to contain nearly 800,000 cattle, nearly 100,000
horses and mules, and over 200,000 sheep and
goats.</p>

<p>"Beyond this there were the fields of cotton,
maize, rice, sugar-cane, tobacco, and all those
cereals which went to make up the store of the
mission towns, as well as the spreading groves of
orange-trees, and all the fruits of the sub-tropics
and of Southern Europe which were cultivated
with immense success in the rich red soil of Paraguay.
It is a tribute to the energy of the Jesuits,
moreover, that sufficient wheat was grown within
the missions to render them self-supporting in this
respect, when the small amount of wheat is taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
into consideration that is at present produced within
the Republic of Paraguay.</p>

<p>"It was in these pastoral and agricultural pursuits
that the main supply of Guaraní labour was
employed. The Jesuits saw to it that the tasks
of the Indians were made as attractive as possible.
Thus they would march to the fields singing chants
and preceded by a small band of instruments, and
they would return in the same impressive fashion
when the labours of the day were done. In all
such ways as this the work of the Indians was
lightened, and undoubtedly the policy possessed its
practical side in that far more satisfactory agricultural
results were obtained from these contented
people than would have been the case had they
been dejected and apathetic.</p>

<p>"The scope of the mission work, however, was
by no means confined to the pastoral and agricultural
pursuits. The community was entirely self-supporting,
and it was thus necessary to quarry
the stone of which the town buildings were constructed,
to build the small vessels in which much
of the produce was sent to be sold in the large
cities lower down the river, and even to found the
cannons and to produce the gunpowder which were
necessary in order to defend the settlements from
the slave-raiding attacks of those arch-enemies of
the missions, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mamelucos</i>, who came out with
fire and sword from the Brazilian town of San
Paolo.</p>

<p>"But, when the disposition and attainments of
the original Guaraní tribe are taken into consideration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
some of the most remarkable achievements
of the missionaries were in connection with the finer
arts and crafts rather than with the cruder labours
of the main industries. It is true that at the head
of each of these branches was a Jesuit who was a
complete master of his particular art or craft. But
this alone does not suffice to explain the astonishing
progress made in these directions by a race
that a generation or two before had represented
one of the most primitive types of Indian in the
world&mdash;naked savages without the faculty of hieroglyphics,
unable to count beyond the few first
numbers, ignorant of the very rudiments of music,
and lacking sufficient imagination to provide themselves
even with a reasonable supply of that
superstition which stands for the religion of the
savage.</p>

<p>"Yet it was from these very folk that were produced
craftsmen of a really able type. It was they
who, under the coaching of the missionaries,
learned to become carpenters, to carve stone with
professional cunning, and who became expert locksmiths,
gunsmiths and workers in metals. There
were many weavers and printers, and among them
were a certain number who had actually attained
to the expert art of watchmaking. Among the
most astonishing walks of life, however, to which
the Guaraní was transported was that of painter&mdash;in
the artistic sense of the vocation. Hand in
hand with this art went that of music. Indeed,
one of the proofs of how thoroughly these matters
were undertaken lies in the fact of the bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
over from Europe with a view to teaching the
Guaranís music and singing, of Padre Juan Basco,
who had previously been at the head of an archducal
institution of music.</p>

<p>"A school and a hospital were attached to each
Reduction, and each of these, in addition, was
provided with an asylum for the aged and infirm.
Even here a certain amount of work was carried
on, and the inmates of this institution were given
such light tasks as they could perform."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This colonization system was broken up by the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mamelucos</i>, the greedy folk of San Paolo, who,
having enslaved the Indians of that part of Brazil,
cast envious eyes upon the peaceful labour of the
missions, which they longed to impress in their
own services. They therefore began a series of
merciless onslaughts on the settlements, which,
however, valiantly defended themselves for a time.
But the Arcadia was doomed to fall, and the Jesuits
were expelled from Paraguay in 1768, and little
remains now but the ruin of their wonderful work,
which Nature rapidly covered up with her generous
robes of flower and foliage, as if desirous of hiding
from view the brutalities of mankind in this one
of her fairest provinces of South America.</p>

<p>We shall now leave this fertile heart of the
continent, to traverse with rapid strides a region
of a very different nature: that of the "Far
South"&mdash;a south, however, whose attributes of climate
and general environment are not such as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
generally associate with that point of the compass,
and of which we have obtained a passing glimpse
in our survey of the great Cordillera.</p>

<p>In the southern-most part of the New World,
the tapering portion of the South American continent,
lies a vast region of which comparatively
little is heard or known, yet one which in the
future must take its place in the economic development
of the globe. This is the Territory extending
throughout the lower portion of Argentina,
Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego.</p>

<p>It is a land lying far beyond the Tropics, in
part a sort of Siberia of South America, terminating
in those regions which Magellan described
as "stark with eternal cold."</p>

<p>We generally speak of Argentina and Chile
as if they were compact topographical and political
entities, instead of territories between two and three
thousand miles long, covering zones on the surface
of the globe comparable, as far as latitude is concerned,
to one extending from nigh mid-Africa,
through Europe into Scotland, with climate similarly
varying.</p>

<p>But this southern land has great possibilities.
It has received a bad name, largely resulting upon
the description of Darwin, who visited it in the
voyage of the <em>Beagle</em>, a reputation which more
recent travellers have shown not to be deserved.
Darwin spoke of the "curse of sterility" and of
the eternally "dreary landscape," but, like Siberia,
Patagonia may prove to be a region desirable in
many respects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet Patagonia strikes the traveller as huge and
elemental, and settlement and development, as
far as they go, are but the work of the few recent
years. It offers great and abrupt contrasts of
pampa and mountain, with rivers cutting across the
plains from the Andes to the Atlantic.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the Atlantic coastline it is four or five
days' ride to the nearest farm. In the interior
Nature enfolds you with her large, loose grasp.
Who, having once seen them, can forget the Pampas?
Evening, and the sun sloping over the edge
of the plain like an angry eye, an inky-blue mirage
half blotting it out; in the middle distance grass
rolling like an ocean to the horizon, lean thorn,
and a mighty roaring wind. This wild land, ribbed
and spined by one of the greatest mountain chains
in the world, appears to have been the last habitation
of the great beasts of the older ages. It is
now the last country of all to receive man, or
rather its due share of human population. Out
there in the heart of the country one seems to stand
alone, with nothing nearer or more palpable than
the wind, the fierce mirages, and the limitless
distances."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>However, farms and cattle ranges are springing
up, and Nature has placed in one spot on the coast
an important petroleum field, to say nothing of the
valuable forests.</p>

<p>This far southern region of South America is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
shared by the British Empire, in its distant outpost
of the Falkland Isles, forming its most
southerly colony. The latitude here in the south
corresponds roughly to that of England in the
north, but climate is very different, with a constantly
overcast and rainy sky, although the
extremes of heat and cold are far less. The treeless,
grass-covered lands maintain large numbers
of sheep. The little capital of Stanley is mainly
built of wood, with a Government House of grey
stone, calling to mind an Orkney or Shetland
manse. There is nothing of Spanish American
atmosphere here. Far from the mainland, the
only association with the continent of South
America of the Falkland Isles is that they are the
headquarters of the bishop of that diocese, which,
as we have seen elsewhere, covers so wide a field
in Spanish America, and perhaps the fact that
Argentina still regards the possession of these
somewhat melancholy and remote sea-girt isles by
Britain with disapproval; claiming them as hers.
The name is immortal in the destruction of the
German fleet in those waters during the Great
War.</p>

<h2><span class="headersmallfont">CHAPTER XV</span><br />
<span class="headerlargefont">TRADE AND FINANCE</span></h2>

<p>There is a certain element of interest, apart from
money-making, attaching to commerce with that
wide and varied group of peoples which come
under the distinctive nomenclature of the Latin
American Republics, and this is perhaps a fortunate
circumstance. There is, as already remarked,
an element of adventure about trade
operations therewith which may be said to stimulate
and assist enterprise&mdash;the enterprise of buying
and selling in those remote and still half-developed
communities.</p>

<p>Your merchant packs and dispatches his wares,
marking his packages with names and destinations
whose lettering and pronunciation, though they
may cost him an effort to write or speak correctly,
have in them something redolent of the blue seas
and skies of the Tropics, upon whose shores they
will presently be landed, to be handed over&mdash;the
attentions of cigarette-smoking and gold-laced
Customs officers satisfied amid much Castilian
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chárla</i>&mdash;to the mercies in many cases of rude but
patient muleteers, when, bound on the backs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
mules they will be borne over mountain paths and
through tangled jungles to many a distant interior
village of the Pampas or the Cordillera.</p>

<p>And those returning goods which lie upon our
quays, fresh from the hold of the steamer which
brought them hither, have their own origin
stamped upon them, and often betray by their
aroma their special nature. Who has not walked
upon the docks and remarked with interest the
bales of coffee, the piles of hides, the sacks of
ore, the packages of raw cocoa and other raw
material sent hither, the product of industrious
natives of the picturesque <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hacienda</i> and the mine?</p>

<p>Your commercial traveller, too, if he be a man
of parts&mdash;and such he must be to treat successfully
in these communities&mdash;smells the battle from afar,
and, setting forth again, girds himself thereto, prepared
to exercise that needful show of courtesy
which even commercial dealings require in those
lands where Spanish and Portuguese is the
medium of barter or sale, and schools his tongue
to speak in their softer accents.</p>

<p>The trade of Latin America is now a much
coveted field. The English merchant, who long
held this field, has now to contend with the keen
competition of others. There was, before the war,
the German, who by ability and craft had firmly
and remuneratively established himself therein, and
who now seeks to build up the trade edifice which
the punishment of his criminal war has caused to
fall. There is the American, as keen as any,
studying by what means he may overcome the disadvantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
which worked against his more successful
exploitation of the Latin American sphere in
the past, and thinking, perhaps, to predominate
over his rivals. There are the French, the Italian,
the Spaniard and others, all demanding their
share; and coming forward now is the Japanese,
acclaiming his right to whatever he may wrest,
either from the sphere of his competitors or in the
finding of fresh pastures.</p>

<p>From whence is this keen desire to profit by the
trade of the Central and South American States?
Despite its attendant risks, of distance, of long
credits, of "slow payers" and repudiated debts,
it must be profitable. There must be a demand
for goods, a wide and sufficient market and a
margin of considerable balance over costs and
expenses.</p>

<p>This is, in fact, the case; but as we shall note,
it is possible to overdraw these attractions of the
counting-house and the manufactory.</p>

<p>Latin America is a territory whose wealth and
population are growing. There is an increasing
class demanding the things of luxury and necessity
which Europe and North America produce, and
which Japan produces&mdash;for it will be unwise to
leave these sharp-witted traders of Asia out of our
survey. The Latin American peoples are plastic
and emotional, imitative, pleasure-loving, fond of
personal adornment. They are emerging from the
poverty and austerity of the influence of the
Colonial period. Some of them are very wealthy.
Their women must be clad in expensive finery;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
their homes must be furnished with showy furniture;
upon their tables must lie the delicacies
that other nations enjoy.</p>

<p>So far they have not learned to exercise the
ingenuity latent within them to make these things&mdash;although
here is a factor we shall shortly
consider&mdash;for themselves, and, in consequence,
a stream of articles,&mdash;textiles, machinery, clothing,
prepared foodstuffs, jewellery, furniture and all else&mdash;takes
its way from foreign ports towards their
shores.</p>

<p>It is part of our task here to consider what
are the conditions of successful trading in these
growing communities, but before doing so it will
be well to sound a note of caution as to over-exaggerated
expectations of trade and profits in
Latin America.</p>

<p>In the first place an unlimited market for exported
articles of luxury and need argues a considerable
class of persons capable of absorbing
such.</p>

<p>Compared with other communities, the purchasing
class of Latin America cannot be regarded
as very extensive. We have here a score of
States or Republics whose total population perhaps
approximates eighty million souls, all but a small
proportion of whom, probably less than ten per
cent., are folk of the poorest class, without purchasing
power for more than the barest necessities
or simplest articles of everyday life&mdash;articles
which they themselves can produce&mdash;the great bulk
of them illiterate Indians or Mestizos. Until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
standard of life of these people be raised very
considerably&mdash;and there is little evidence of this
uplifting so far&mdash;they cannot develop either the
power or the inclination to spend. Their masters&mdash;like
masters all the world over&mdash;pay them the
lowest possible wage, blind to the economic fact
that this parsimony rebounds upon themselves,
stinting production, output, consumption and
demand.</p>

<p>Thus it is that the purchasing power of the
Latin American population is a limited one, and
markets and warehouses may readily be over-stocked,
stuffed&mdash;as has happened on various occasions&mdash;with
goods which cannot be sold, or
must be sold at a loss.</p>

<p>Especially is this the case with articles of textile
manufacture, bales of cloth, dress fabrics and so
forth, when all the large emporiums and shops
have had their shelves loaded and could digest
no more. All the merchants of Spanish American
capitals and large towns have experienced this, and
although the cessation of imports during the war
emptied the shelves and disorganized their markets,
it cannot be long, given the keen desire to forward
goods from abroad, when the same plethora
will recur.</p>

<p>There is a further condition to consider, of still
greater economic importance.</p>

<p>The tendency of nations in the future is bound
to become more and more self-supplying in the
manufacture or production of articles of everyday
consumption. The spread of knowledge, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
need for local employment, the high cost of production
and&mdash;a very important matter&mdash;the high
cost of carriage or transport, which latter, in fact,
is becoming prohibitive in some cases, are all
factors making towards the principle of self-supply.</p>

<p>As an economic principle, this of self-supply
is altogether sound, and its extension to the
utmost is advisable and beneficial. It will help
to eliminate waste; it will perhaps work against
over-production and over-competition, both wasteful
forces; it will tend to conserve the native
resources of the globe, especially in fuel and raw
material, which, during the "factory age," have
been severely drawn upon and in many instances
ruthlessly wasted. To produce a thing where it
is to be consumed, we may repeat, rather than
carrying it over seas and continents from distant
producer to consumer, is a sound economic and
sociological principle, so far little recognised.</p>

<p>The growth of such conditions, however, is not
likely to be of benefit to trade in general. One
of the first branches of manufacture to be affected
thereby is the textile industry of Britain and other
lands as regards the export trade. It has been
shown in these pages that the Latin American
countries, in some instances, have now set up their
own mills and are manufacturing their own
textiles. This is specially true of such countries
as Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and others, where
the production of "piece goods" and other textiles
and articles of clothing is being extensively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
carried out with marked success, and with a
corresponding limitation of import. These mills
are often worked by water-power, and so are free
from the difficult and expensive element of fuel.
Labour, moreover, is much cheaper, even if less
efficient, than abroad.</p>

<p>The same condition is growing as regards other
manufactured articles, and there is no physical
reason why the whole of the Latin American
States should not manufacture many articles for
their own requirements which at present they
import. They possess within their own shores all
the necessary raw material, except in some
few instances.</p>

<p>But do they possess the skill to make these
articles? There is little doubt that the Latin
American folk, the artisan, the mechanic, the
craftsman, are learning the methods of manufacture
in many fields. They may not be an inventive
folk, but they are an imitative folk, and possessed
withal of great patience and painstaking ingenuity.</p>

<p>These last-named qualities are revealed in their
ancient native industries. Any one who takes the
trouble to examine the examples of these old crafts
will often be struck by their beauty and ingenuity.
In textile work they excelled. The old tapestries
of the Inca and the fabrics of the Aztec, and
of the Queches of Guatemala, of the Mayas, and,
in brief, all others of the cultured or semi-cultured
early folk of Spanish America reveal this, and
examples are to be seen in the museums. The
Indians of the Andes to-day make their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
"tweeds" of sheep or llama wool; also their own
felt hats. They weave ponchos of Alpaca wool
that are waterproof, so closely are they hand-woven.
They dyed these things in beautiful native
patterns (often of much archæological interest)
with native dyes which in some cases were superior
to the imported synthetic dyes of Europe. As a
matter of fact, it is unfortunate from a true
economic and artistic point of view that these
native industries should be displaced by outside
products.</p>

<p>Again, such articles as the Panama hat of
Ecuador and Colombia show of what the Indian
is capable; as did the beautiful jewellery, in
precious metals and stones, of the ancient culture-area
of Central America, or the exquisite vessels
and objects of adornment of the Incas, some of
which still exist. The powers in stone-working
are seen by the remarkable structures scattered
over the whole Spanish American world, revealing
the use of the chisel.</p>

<p>There is, however, no need here to labour this
argument, but it is more than possible that a
marked growth of Latin American craftsmanship
will come to being again, under the stimulus of
modern needs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is not to be supposed
that the foreign manufacturer is likely immediately
to find the ground cut away from under his feet.
There are numerous articles of commerce which
the Latin American folk do not, and possibly
cannot, make for themselves, or not yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Among these matters is the important one of
machinery. So far, throughout the length and
breadth of the Latin American States, not a single
locomotive has ever had its birth, and that in a
land where the locomotive is so essential a factor.
Nor is bar iron or steel rail rolled anywhere here
(except possibly a little experimental work in
Mexico and elsewhere). In fact, the manipulation
of iron and steel has not yet come to being.</p>

<p>When we take note of the mines to be worked,
the cotton, sugar and other mills and factories
to be equipped, the railways to be built and maintained,
the demand for motor-cars, the call for
agricultural machinery, the use of household
utensils of iron and steel, the wire fencing and a
host of articles, it is evident that the field of trade
here will not yet be cut off.</p>

<p>In the superior textile again, skill has not yet
reached a capacity to supply all wants. The
growing requirements of people to be clothed by
the best class of goods will doubtless long keep
up the imports of such, unless governments institute
absolutely prohibitive tariffs&mdash;a matter upon
which it is impossible to speculate.</p>

<p>It would be out of our province here to deal
in detail with the various articles of trade in the
Latin American field. There are recent sources
of such information which fill all requirements.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>There is an important condition in connection
with the conduct of business in Spanish America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
This is, in the more leisurely and courteous bearing
observed in such transactions, and the commercial
traveller or his chief is well advised to
study it.</p>

<p>The merchant or business man here will not be
hustled or too brutally&mdash;in a commercial sense&mdash;approached.
A friendly chat, inquiries as to
matters of mutual interest, or upon current events,
or regarding the members of each other's family,
or other subjects general or politely personal, paves
the way to the more concrete business of the
occasion.</p>

<p>"Personality" counts for much in Spanish
American relations, not only in society but in
business. The Spanish-speaking people have a
word for which in English we have no exact
equivalent; that is the word, or adjective,
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">simpatico</i> (or the feminine form <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">simpatica</i>). It
does not necessarily mean exactly "sympathetic"
or "personal magnetism"&mdash;to use the latter rather
stupid English term. It means intuitive, comprehensive.
A person who is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">simpatico</i> may command
much greater attention than one who is not.</p>

<p>It is to be recollected that the Latin American
man of any position is, or aims at being, a
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caballero</i>, a gentleman, and it is to be remarked
that this is a pleasing and valuable ideal, which
might well be more closely cultivated amid the
often boorish methods of Anglo-Saxondom.</p>

<p>Thus your commercial traveller should accept
the proffered cigar or cigarette&mdash;there is generally
such an offer&mdash;of his desired client, or offer one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
himself, and not attempt to come immediately to
the point or instantly thrust his wares beneath
the nose of the person upon whom he calls, hoping
to make an immediate sale and rush out to perform
the same operation on perhaps a rival dealer next
door.</p>

<p>That "Time is money" has also its rendering
in Spanish: <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tiempo es oro</i>, and it does not follow
that business will be delayed by diplomatic
methods. Yet this habit of courtesy should not
merely be acquired as a trick. Business is sometimes
carried through in a quicker way than in
Europe or the United States, and the term the
"land of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mañana</i>" has often been over-applied,
at least as regards business transactions.</p>

<p>Again, it must be recollected that the Ibero-American&mdash;with
a touch perhaps of Orientalism&mdash;does
not always like to give a direct "yes" or
"no." In the latter case, perhaps, he does not
wish to hurt his visitor's feelings, and may leave
him to infer a negative from the general conversation.
This should be understood, and a direct
reply not sought.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this method of courtesy does
not necessarily apply to all operations of dealing.
The rudeness of the shop-hand in Latin American
towns is a matter of note often; his brusqueness
and incivility. It is possible that this may arise in
part from the custom of haggle; that is, of not
having fixed prices for articles sold, and the customer,
especially women, enter and argue to a
wearisome length often, in obtaining a reduction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
or finger the goods to such an extent as to
exasperate the whole race of counter attendants.
Be it as it may, courtesy by the shopkeeper is
not a marked condition here. There are, of
course, exceptions.</p>

<p>We shall also remark a further condition. The
Latin American is generally more urbane in his
conduct than the Spaniard. The pure Iberian is
often a very direct fellow, blunt of speech and
behaviour. Often his speech, when excited, is
interlarded with the most tremendous oaths.</p>

<p>These matters of deportment are not necessarily
intricate, and they should not be overdone.
Frankness and sincerity always appeal. The
Spanish American wishes to appear to be direct.
He will tell you he is so. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Yo soy franco, señor</i>&mdash;"I
am frank," he will frequently exclaim in the
course of any argumentative conversation, or,
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Vamos á ser practicos</i>&mdash;"let us be practical." It
does not, of course, follow that he is always either
frank or practical. Often, however, he is.</p>

<p>The Englishman generally finds that prejudice
is in his favour in these circles. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ingles</i> has
a name for fair and straightforward dealing (which
Heaven grant always is and always may be
deserved!). Here we have the well-known and
oft-quoted aphorism of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Palabra de Ingles</i>;
that is, the "word of an Englishman," which is
reputedly held to be as good as his bond. He
is supposed to carry out, without chicanery or
mental reservation, what he has undertaken to do.
His goods will be up to the sample; his fulfilment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
as his promise. He will often find this national
trait appraised here, and often with disparagement
of the methods of the traders of other nationalities,
and this not merely as a form of subtle
flattery.</p>

<p>Whether this high standard is always now
kept, under the pressure of increasing competition,
it may be left to others to determine.</p>

<p>Again, the excellence of British manufacture is
generally looked upon as a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>Cheap goods, such as textiles, however, in the
face of this competition, wherever they come from,
are probably often very free from reproach, and
an enormous quantity of cheap rubbish must find
its way on to the backs of the poorer wearers in
these lands, of British and other manufacture.</p>

<p>Against the British manufacturer there is always
the old outstanding accusation that he does not
sufficiently regard the tastes or needs of his clients
overseas, but adopts a "take-it-or-leave-it attitude,"
and this is a point writers on the subject
generally bring forward. Doubtless it has been
somewhat exaggerated.</p>

<p>Again, another theme is that of disregard of
the important matters of packing, both as to external
appearances of boxes and packages which
are to be exposed for sale and the packing for
means of transport such as the exigencies of the
road call for here.</p>

<p>Many writers on British trade take it upon
themselves to disparage their own methods and
institutions, but this has been overdone. If there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
are defects in British methods, they occur equally
in those of the traders of other nations. However,
self-disparagement is a British characteristic in
many things, and may readily be discounted.</p>

<p>The subject of finance, credits and so forth are
matters which always come up for discussion here.
Long credits are often necessary, especially in the
case of the smaller merchants or dealers of Latin
America, and in the smaller towns, where these
have not capital for quick payments and the goods
have to be sold before a return is reaped. There
may be bad debts often, or dishonest customers,
but as a rule the purchasing store-keeper is often
kept in the path of rectitude by the knowledge that
dishonesty will result in cutting off his supplies
sooner or later, with consequent ruination.</p>

<p>To return to business. It is an error to suppose
that the Latin American is lacking in enterprise,
for the reverse is generally the case.</p>

<p>Again, the folk of these lands we are here
treading are exceedingly assimilative of new ideas
and novelties. They like to be thought "up-to-date."
New appliances and luxuries catch their
fancy. Motor-cars, gramophones, cinematographs
and so forth are eagerly purchased. Were the
roads better, bicycles would have had an enormous
vogue, and may yet have. Aeroplanes are likely
to be very prominent things in the future. Anything
new, fashionable or pleasurable is regarded
with favour, from notepaper to flying machines.</p>

<p>It is, however, noteworthy that the deeper
refinements of life are less considered. Thus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Latin American folk are not great readers of books
or purchasers of pictures. Nor have they a great
love for antiques. It is true that books published
in Spanish (or Portuguese) are generally limited in
range and miserably printed and bound, and it is
probable that a foreign publisher who should
undertake to cater to a growing literary appetite
here would find in it a remunerative business.
Something, of course, has been done in this way,
especially in Argentina, where imports of books
from Britain have increased rapidly.</p>

<p>As to pictures, gaudy oleographs and calendars
often do duty for these. But the love of pictures
for themselves seems to have diminished at the
present time among all peoples, even in Anglo-Saxondom:
perhaps it has fled before more
material delights; perhaps it may return.</p>

<p>The British Governmental attitude towards trade
abroad&mdash;and Latin America naturally takes an
important place&mdash;somewhat halts between two
opinions, as concerns official representation. Shall
British representatives be mainly diplomatic,
ambassadorial, or shall they also descend to that
less distinguished field of commerce? Shall the
atmosphere of the Minister Plenipotentiary or that
of the more commercialized Consul be paramount?</p>

<p>England&mdash;Britain&mdash;is constantly upbraided by
traders and trade-writers on account of her alleged
supineness with regard to foreign trade. We are
accused of not doing enough, of not having sufficiently
active representatives abroad, of not attending
to the wants of foreign purchasers, of not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
knowing their languages, of not sufficiently pressing
our wares upon them, and so forth.</p>

<p>But when all is said that can be said upon this
subject, it must be recollected that Britain has
had a very prosperous day as the workshop of the
world, and has greatly enriched herself in foreign
markets. There seems little doubt that she is
disposed to rest somewhat on her laurels now.
Apart from this, there are physical causes why it
is difficult for Britain to pretend to hold predominance
here, as well as sociological reasons.
A steady export trade should be aimed at, not a
feverish attempt at perpetual predominance.</p>

<p>We turn now to the important matters of foreign
investment and finance in these widely diversified
lands of Latin America.</p>

<p>The statistics of finance inform us that, among
the oversea enterprises of the British capitalist,
more than a thousand million pounds sterling are
invested in stocks, bonds and shares in undertakings
in the Republics of Latin America; securities
quoted upon the London Stock Exchange.
There are further enterprises not so quoted. From
this considerable sum a steady stream of dividends
flows to Great Britain, amounting to over eighty
million pounds per annum.</p>

<p>In these statistics we have an indication of the
great activity that has taken place in the past by
the British individual, or joint-stock company
in this field, from Mexico to Peru or Chile, from
Venezuela and Colombia to Brazil or the River
Plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherever we journey in Spanish America, we
shall find our countrymen engaged in some important
enterprise or industry. If we ascend to
the high plateau of Mexico it will be upon an
English owned and operated railway, from the
coast of Vera Cruz, which we have reached upon
an English steamer. If we enter the rich mines
here we shall see English capital extracting gold
and silver, which flows to London, and other
minerals too. If we survey Mexico City, we shall
see that it and its lake-basin is drained by a
wonderful canal and tunnel, a work which the
Aztecs and the early Spaniards tried to perform
but failed in, and do we cross from sea to sea over
the Tehuantepec Isthmus it will be upon a railway
rebuilt, with fine harbours at each approach&mdash;a
competitor, in some respects, with the Panama
Canal&mdash;by English engineers and money, whilst
the electric lights and trams of the capital are
nourished from the same source. (The tramway
system, indeed, from the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">centavos</i> of the travelling
Mexican poor, pay or did pay the working costs
before nine o'clock in the morning, leaving the
rest of the day for the dividends.)</p>

<p>In South America we can scarcely take train
in any of the numerous Republics without travelling
over rails laid down by the genius of Albion, or
without helping, in the purchase of our ticket, to
contribute towards the exchequer of the British
company which built or controls it. When we rise
from the Spanish Main to the mountains of Venezuela
or Colombia, it is upon lines made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
British brains and purses; or when we go up from
sea-level to the dizzy heights of the Andes of Peru
or Chile, it is behind the iron horse whose trajectory
or working has been rendered possible by
Britain. The wonderful network of rails that
traverse Brazil and Argentina, and bring forth to
the seaboard the product of corn, cattle, coffee and
all else, were built with gold from Lombard
Street, as were the docks and harbours whence
they discharge their wealth of products from the
hinterland. Again, if we penetrate the dark
reaches of the Amazon, England is giving gas light,
electric light, water supply, dock service and much
else there; and we shall have ascended that mighty
stream on an English steamer. Nay, some of the
rubber of these forests is extracted by the power
of British gold. Banks are largely British.</p>

<p>England, in brief, has performed an enormous
service in the New World with her money. The
United States built itself up on British capital, so
that every Republic in America has had cause
for gratitude for the use of English gold.
England is not a gold-producing country, but
nevertheless a stream of gold has proceeded from
her shores to nourish the most distant lands.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<h2><span class="headersmallfont">CHAPTER XVI</span><br />
<span class="headerlargefont">TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW</span></h2>

<p>In our travels throughout the very extensive and
varied regions dealt with in these pages, we shall
have remarked certain outstanding features of life
characteristic in perhaps peculiar degree of the
Latin American civilization. The marked division
of the classes into which the social life of the
Republics falls, the system of government, the distinctive
architecture, civil and ecclesiastical, the
peculiar mining industry&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sui generis</i>; the roads&mdash;or
absence of such&mdash;and the special atmosphere
surrounding travel in the wilds, the undeveloped
condition of enormous areas of territory and their
lack of population, the absence of manufacturing
industry and predominance of rural occupations,
the relations with foreigners, and the relations&mdash;or
lack of such&mdash;of an inter-American nature; whilst
there has always been before the observer interested
in the sociological development of the world,
the problems of the future here.</p>

<p>Despite eccentricities of character and difficulties
of environment, we shall remark that Spanish
American government and other institutions are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
in general, laid down upon excellent lines, and in
the future may be expected to develop in their
own way.</p>

<p>As to government, the constitutions&mdash;written
constitutions&mdash;of these States might be described
almost as counsels of perfection. Theoretically
they provide for all contingencies, and, were they
followed, little would be amiss. Unfortunately the
temperament of the Latin American people often
is, that the individual will lay down the most
excellent laws for the community, but apparently
reserving for himself the right to contravene them,
as far as he is concerned, if occasion so demand.
Herein is the difficulty of self-government under
the Iberian temperament.</p>

<p>The constitutions of the Republics are generally
modelled upon that of the United States; but
there is a slight difference between the associations
of the various provinces or departments in some
cases. Thus the Federal Republic Model, under
which the provinces enjoy a species of home
rule, has been adopted by Brazil, Mexico and
Venezuela, whilst the remainder have what is
termed the centralized form, the supreme head
being the capital, with prefects set over the
provinces.</p>

<p>The governing powers embody the executive,
the legislative and the judicial; the president and
his cabinet, national congress of two chambers,
and a supreme tribunal. Ministers with portfolios
are generally those of Foreign Affairs, Finance,
Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, Communications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and Public Works, War and Marine, to
which is frequently added a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ministro de Fomento</i>,
after the Spanish model, a department which concerns
itself with the development of new industries
and means of transport, land concessions, and so
forth, the word meaning "encouragement" or
"fostering."</p>

<p>A considerable bureaucracy naturally exists
under this regimen, and there is a strong tendency
among the educated folk to seek Government employ.
On the whole, however, the system of
government, with its ramifications, must be
regarded as efficient and competent, and the
machinery works smoothly. It is not necessarily
thrown out of gear altogether by the sudden revolution
or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">golpe de estado</i>, which so frequently
occurs, unless this be more than ordinarily severe.
But the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caudillo</i>, the political leader or "boss"
(to use an American equivalent) is often a corrupting
and disturbing element.</p>

<p>With regard to the religious system, the regimen
and machinery of the Romish Church is, too, well
organized, from arch-bishop down to village <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cura</i>
or priest. But the education and character of
this last often leaves a good deal to be
desired.</p>

<p>As with government, so is it with education in
the Latin American countries. The theory is excellent,
and education is everywhere extolled, but
in practice the proportion of literates, indeed of
folk who can but read and write alone, is exceedingly
small, amounting perhaps to ten or fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
per cent. of the population, rising to fifty per cent.
in the most advanced land, Argentina. Education
is everywhere free and compulsory, and the Latin
American youth can reach the universities with
little cost.</p>

<p>The conditions of civic life in Spanish American
lands are often pleasing in some essentials, and
students of sociology and economics might well
find matters of utility here. It might not be an
exaggeration to say that there is more public spirit,
of a kind, in a small Spanish American town than
in its English or United States equivalent. More
interest is taken in local government; there is
more discussion in local matters. The inhabitant,
if he has any grade of education and knowledge,
thinks it natural to assert his opinion as a unit of
his habitat, and public opinion is a strong factor.
It is a good augury for the future.</p>

<p>Indeed, in the connection, it is to be noted that
Spanish American people&mdash;even in circles where
it would be supposed that such matters would be
beyond their ken&mdash;think much and talk profoundly
on questions of government, polity, economics and
so forth. They display a wider range of intelligence
than&mdash;for example&mdash;the lower middle-class
English folk in such matters.</p>

<p>Useful and pleasing features in civic life are to
be found in the general "town-planning" of the
Latin American town or village. The Spaniards
inaugurated the general plan of a central plaza or
square, with streets radiating therefrom, and cross
streets&mdash;the well-known "chequer board" style.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
It is quite possible to overdo this system, or to
adhere too rigidly thereto. But the central plaza,
with the church and municipal buildings, chief
shops and so forth around it, is a convenient
arrangement, whilst the institution of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">serenata</i>
or open-air concert here, on Sunday afternoon
and during week-day evenings, brings the people
together and creates a pleasing atmosphere, and
is, in fact, a social amenity of value. The plaza
is the pulse of the locality.</p>

<p>It is, of course, to be recollected that the climate
generally permits such amenities. Also, as the
roads cease on the outskirts of the place, there is
really nowhere else for the inhabitants to take exercise
on foot. We should not like to sacrifice our
typical English village, with its High Street and
church on the hill, to this more stereotyped plan,
but the amenities of the plaza might be much
more widely copied. It has its nucleus in the
village green, but the social atmosphere is
lacking in this last.</p>

<p>The traveller in the cities and towns of Spanish
America finds himself, often without knowing or
analysing the cause, in an atmosphere quaint, restful
and pleasing. He seems transplanted to an
old-world or semi-mediaeval environment, as of
some more ancient or remote place of European
lands where the vulgarizing hand of the commercial
age is as yet unknown. Looking around and
above him he finds the sensation is imparted by
the buildings, the façades of the streets, the
churches and the general disposition architecturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of the place. It is the atmosphere and influence
of the old Spanish Colonial architecture.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the very considerable extent
and interest of this field, few writers on Spanish
America appear to have made any broad study of
the subject, or at least to have set down much in
the way of description of what is so noteworthy
and important a feature of life in these widely-scattered
communities, but it is a matter worthy
of some study.</p>

<p>This type of architecture is, naturally, more
intensively represented in those parts of the
Spanish American Continent which were the principal
seats of viceregal rule, such as Mexico and
Peru, but the style predominates throughout the
whole of Central and South America, and in the
West Indian Islands, such as Cuba and Santo
Domingo, which were under Spanish sway. The
example set, the style was followed to a considerable
extent after the time of Independence, and
with some modification, subservient to modern
economic, domestic or commercial requirements,
is employed in modern erections. Here, however,
a new note has been introduced, an unpleasing
note, and the dignified and quaint "classic"
of the Colonial architecture has to some extent
given place to a cheaper-appearing "Gothic,"
which, beside the older style, often appears frivolous
or tawdry, although its exponents may derive
some satisfaction from their claim to be "modern"
and "progressive." The façades of the streets&mdash;and
the circumstance is notable especially in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
larger cities&mdash;has in some cases been vulgarized
by the erection of huge business premises or blocks,
in which the utilitarian has triumphed over the
dignified and chaste.</p>

<p>There is less call for comment on this last-named
condition in such centres as Buenos Ayres
and others, which have sprung to being in comparatively
recent times, and even Rio de Janeiro;
but even here, as in modern Rio de Janeiro, the
old chaste style has been widely reproduced and
perpetuated, side by side with the "commercial"
order and the somewhat riotous stucco architecture
of the plutocratic residence.</p>

<p>The principal features of the Colonial style of
street architecture are the square-headed windows
with their moulded architraves, and, more elaborately,
pediments, and the prominent cornices,
friezes and sills. The balcony to the upper
windows, and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rejas</i> or iron grilles, to the lower&mdash;the
latter originally and indeed still a necessary
safeguard, from various causes&mdash;are the most prominent
features, together with the wide <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">saguan</i>
or principal doorway, high enough for a mounted
horseman to enter, giving access to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> or
courtyard, around which, generally open to the
sky, the interior doors and windows are disposed&mdash;a
type, of course, inherited from the Moors through
Spain. The houses are built close against the
street. There is no garden or space in front, but
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> is generally planted, often beautifully so,
with shrubs and flowers, often with the addition
of a fountain. Around the upper wall of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
a gallery runs, reached by an outside staircase,
giving access to the various apartments of the first
floor.</p>

<p>In the public buildings, and in the more elaborate
private mansions, such as the main residential
streets of the capitals display, the window-heads
are frequently arched. Much effect is gained by
the method of severity in the greater part of the
façade, with elaborate carving disposed where
needful. The material is generally of stone in the
older buildings, and in the newer&mdash;but with an
effect that does not deceive&mdash;the scheme is carried
out in plaster or stucco, whose appearance is sometimes
too artificial. The most notable feature of
the façades of those buildings which form the sides
of the plazas, or public squares, are the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">portales</i>
or arcades, of arches supported on columns, a
covered footpath thus being formed, with the upper
stories of the buildings thereover. This type
of building is, of course, common to Latin
countries in Europe.</p>

<p>When we come to the church architecture of
the Spanish American towns, we enter a somewhat
different field. Enormous work has been lavished
upon them. Their façades are sometimes loaded
with the most ornate carvings, exciting admiration
for the beauty and dexterity of their individual
parts, but giving occasion for the criticism of being
overdone and overburdened.</p>

<p>The cathedrals and churches of the larger
Mexican cities are things to marvel at, in many
instances. So intricate, beautiful and elaborate is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the ornamentation which has been lavished upon
these and other ecclesiastical structures, even in
remote towns whose very name is unknown to the
ordinary European traveller, that words fail to
describe them, and they must be seen to be appreciated.
The work was performed mainly in the
time of the viceroys.</p>

<p>The temples of Peru are less noteworthy, but
nevertheless follow out in some degree the same
lavish style, as evidenced in the sacred edifices
of Lima and to a less extent those of Cuzco and
Arequipa. If Mexico was a "city of palaces"
(as Humboldt termed it), Lima has at least claims
to be considered a city of beautiful ecclesiastical
structures.</p>

<p>Other Spanish American capitals may also point
with pride to the beauty of their old public and
consecrated buildings, and, indeed, Spanish culture
in this respect, the fervour and piety of the Romish
Church in Iberian hands, has conferred a benefit
upon the New World for which it might well be
grateful. Throughout thousands of miles of savage
territory Spain caused to arise these oases of
religious and monastic culture, appreciation of
which the lapse of time, rather than diminishing,
should augment.</p>

<p>Let us consider in some brief detail a few
examples of the Colonial mural art. In Mexico
there is such lavish wealth that we must be content
with a few examples.</p>

<p>A building generally regarded by the Mexicans
as perhaps one of the most chaste and pleasing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
their public edifices, although not one of the oldest,
is that of the former Temple of San Augustin, of
which a picture is here given. It was erected in
1692, and, after the time of the Reform, when
ecclesiasticism was dispossessed, it became, by
mandate of President Juarez, the Biblioteca
Nacional, or Public Library of the city of Mexico.
The lower portion is Ionic, the upper partakes of
the Churrigueresque style, which predominated
in New Spain from the sixteenth century,
replacing the severer architecture prior to that
period.</p>

<p>Here, amid the two hundred thousand volumes
of the library, are documents, little known and
unprinted, containing valuable matter concerning
the early history of America.</p>

<p>In contrast with the moderately severe style of
the above is the façade of the principal entrance
of the Sagrario, or Basilica Metropolitana, intricately
sculptured portals of majestic character, a
network of carved pilasters and figures, a typical
work of Churriguera, which compels the admiration
of the visitor. It is built of the red <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tezontle</i>
stone, compact and clear-hued, adding to its
ornate beauty.</p>

<p>The temple abuts upon the garden of the
cathedral. This splendid structure is the finest
from some points of view, of its nature, in the
whole of America, north or south. Its two great
towers, rising for two hundred feet from the pavement,
are landmarks far and wide throughout the
Valley of Mexico. It is four hundred feet long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and two hundred wide, in the form of a Greek
cross, with two naves and three aisles and twenty-two
side chapels. The vaulted roof is supported
by twenty Doric columns, and its great candelabra
of gold, silver and copper, altars, rare paintings
and other appointments, render it a notable
example of church architecture.</p>

<p>There are sixty massive churches in Mexico
City, and as many more old convents and monasteries,
or such was their original purpose before
they were turned over to secular uses by the
Reform. The domes&mdash;for many are domed&mdash;and
towers of the ancient buildings stand out finely
from the mass of the city, as beheld from the hills
which surround the valley, bearing witness to the
devout, the fanatic, the love of the beautiful which
inspired Mexico under the viceroys. The cathedral
was erected to face the great Zocalo or plaza
on whose site stood the Teocalli or pyramid of the
Aztec war god, a scene of bloody rites and barbarous
sacrifice, stormed by Cortes and his
Spaniards and razed to the ground.</p>

<p>The view here given of one of the side streets
of the Mexican capital serves to show the type of
severe street architecture before described, and
affords a glimpse of the towers of the cathedral.
Upon the street, face old residences of Spanish
nobles or viceroys, and one side of the Palacio
Nacional, formerly the residence of Cortes. The
solid blocks of red <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tezontle</i> of which they are built,
so largely employed in the Viceregal period, give
a sombre aspect to this broad thoroughfare, lightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
somewhat by the white habit of the Indian
porters on the pavement.</p>

</div>

<p>A beautiful edifice, open to the public by reason
of its use as the principal hotel of the city, is
the Hotel Iturbide, the former residence of that
short-lived and ill-fated emperor of Mexico. Its
interior patio, surrounded by colonnades, is typical
of this class of dwelling, and the slender column
and symmetry of its arches are such as arrest
the visitors' gaze.</p>

<p>Yet another type of public building, remarkable
in its solidity and massive beauty, is the great
Edificio de Mineria, as it is now termed, being
used as a school of engineers, an institution of
which Mexico has been justly proud. This fine
building dates from the end of the eighteenth
century, when the Colonial period was expiring,
and it is typical of the severe style of the period.
Tolsa, the architect of this and some other Mexican
buildings, took his inspiration from Rome and
Greece.</p>

<p>The wonders of Mexican Colonial architecture
are not monopolized by the capital. We may find
in the remote towns examples as remarkable,
whether in the great northern towns of the plateau,
whether in the States of Oaxaca and Vera Cruz,
places where the traveller might pass many pleasing
hours, but unknown to the outside world.</p>

<p>A feature of the architecture, or rather decorative
scheme, of Spanish American houses, which
the traveller will not fail to note, is that of the
use of colour on the exterior. This, however, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
not employed on the well-built or stone structures,
but mainly on those of the plastered adobe dwellings
of the lower middle and poorer classes,
although old Government palaces and public
buildings often have a wash or tint over their
faces. Architraves of painted blue or red, panelling
in orange, generous rose-tints over the whole
façade are to be seen, especially in the smaller
towns and the villages.</p>

<p>This custom of exterior house painting is, of
course, from Spain and the Moors. Whilst it may
be objected to as being gaudy, nevertheless it is
often pleasing and picturesque, relieving the
drab aspect of the streets. The adobe wall is,
naturally, plastered with some material, lime or in
some cases&mdash;as at Oruro&mdash;kaolin, thus presenting
a smooth surface for the colour. The colour
material may be paint, or, generally, a kind of
"distemper" or wash.</p>

<p>The effect is an unfamiliar one to the English
or North American traveller, accustomed to the
severe and colourless aspect of his own streets,
but looking along these Spanish American
thoroughfares or highways and byways of the
towns&mdash;which are often the framing for a distant
picture of a far-off Cordillera, blue in the distance,
or a snow-capped peak, or a piece of tawny
desert&mdash;the colour scheme is rather an added
element in the general effect.</p>

<p>We find this custom largely in Mexican towns,
in Central America, in Peru, Bolivia and the Cordillera
generally&mdash;in brief, almost everywhere.</p>

</div>

<p>From the towns we come naturally to the roads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Of the "philosophy of the road" in Spanish
America, I have spoken elsewhere.</p>

<p>It will be impressed upon us in our travels in
the wild regions of Spanish America that, however
fruitful Nature may be here, we cannot adequately
enjoy these fruits until means of transport and
communication are more plentiful and easier.
There are thousands of miles of territory where
the sound of the locomotive has never been heard,
where, indeed, neither road nor bypath exists.
The difficulties of railway and highway building
here are often immense. The topography of the
country is against it; the geological formation, the
climate offer serious obstacles. Precipitous hills
and unstable ground and torrential rainfall render
almost impossible in places either the construction
or maintenance of any form of highway.</p>

<p>Yet we shall doubt if the limit of human ingenuity
has been reached here, and greater
inventive and mechanical genius must be brought
to bear on the problem, in new types of road and
railway. The engineer is somewhat apathetic in
this connection, whether in America or Europe.</p>

<p>The people of Spanish America seem unable
to do much for themselves in the building of railways.
No line is ever built except by British
gold and foreign engineers. They could do much
more themselves, especially as regards roads.</p>

<p>Will air-navigation help to solve the problem
of transport in South America? Perhaps, to a
limited extent. Aeroplane services might be of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
inestimable value in rendering communication possible
with the sequestered towns of the Cordillera,
for example. There are vast open spaces where
landing would be easy, given the overcoming of
atmospheric difficulties. Some investigation is
beginning. In Peru some study of the possible
routes among the mountains has been made. In
Chile the Andes have been crossed by an airman.
Flying, although possibly its "circus" attributes
are most attractive, appeals to the temperament
of the Spanish American. But a Peruvian
airman<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> strove to be the first to cross the Alps,
and gallantly perished in the attempt. Brazil also
furnished its pioneer airman.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Hydroplanes might
be of service, as they could alight on the rivers,
in crossing the Amazon forests.</p>

<p>A glance now at the mining industry, so largely
dependent upon means of transport here.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that gold plays a predominant
part in the mining of to-day in the Latin American
countries. More important is the winning of the
baser metals.</p>

<p>It is, in fact, somewhat remarkable that a land,
fabled earlier for its plenitude of gold, should
in modern times, yield so relatively small an
output. The value of the whole gold production
of the Latin American countries scarcely reaches
the annual amount of £8,000,000, which shrinks
into insignificance beside the £50,000,000 of a
single group of mines in another continent, the
South African Rand. Of this, Mexico produces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
three-quarters, leaving the vast continent of
South America with the small sum, as contribution
to the world's stock of the yellow metal, of some
two million pounds' sterling only.</p>

<p>We may inquire as to the reason of this paucity,
and the reply, in the first instance undoubtedly
is that, although Nature has placed gold in the
rocks and soils of Central and South America in
almost every quarter, the metal is in a form that
does not always lend itself to the winning in large
bulk. The mines are rich, but often small and
scattered. There have not here been discovered
the enormous bodies of ore which, although of
low grade, as in South Africa, by their very extent
and compactness, render mining economically and
physically a more profitable undertaking. Further,
it may be said that, in more recent times, mining
enterprise and the attention of capital needful for
such has not been drawn so strongly to the possibilities
of gold-mining in the Latin American
countries, and, lastly, political unrest and revolution
in these States has in some cases rendered it
precarious.</p>

<p>This last condition need not be exaggerated.
It may be said that the Governments of the Latin
American Republics are, in the main, generous
in their treatment of foreign mining enterprise in
their territories, and that sporadic revolution does
not necessarily seriously affect the working of the
mines, though at times it may cause temporary
inconvenience and possible loss. The foreign
shareholders of the few considerable gold mines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
of South America, and even of Mexico, have in
general reaped excellent returns on their investments.
Conditions in Mexico, however, of late
have been intolerable in some cases, with confiscation
and even murder attending them.</p>

<p>We have remarked the need of a greater
population in the Latin American States, and the
Governments of these in most cases strive to obtain
settlers and workers from Europe, offering often
what appear to be attractive conditions for immigrants.
In Argentina the modern life of the
Republic has in large part been built upon this
element, largely of Italians, and the national
character stands somewhat apart from the other
States from this reason. Brazil has also absorbed
many immigrants of the Latin race from the Old
World, and the Germans here, and in Chile, have
formed important communities.</p>

<p>But much remains to be done in this respect.
It is seen that a good deal of the immigrant
population in Argentina and Brazil remains as a
floating or unsettled element. Much of it does
not go out upon the land, but congregates in
poverty in the cities&mdash;a defect of all immigrant
systems, even in the British Dominions. In
Argentina and Brazil immigrants often cannot
obtain land, although the Governments are seeking
to modify the conditions of vast estate holding
and the rural proletariat.</p>

<p>It may be that the stream of emigrating
humanity from Europe will not flow so freely in
the future, in view of altering conditions on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
older continent. Of late, too, the larger South
American States are inclining towards the restriction
of immigration.</p>

<p>The opportunities for settlement, for taking up
land and establishing industry and reaping reward
and profit in Spanish America are, or rather might
be, attractive. They might be, in some respects,
more attractive than those offered by Britain's
colonies, for reasons which I will give.</p>

<p>Why are these opportunities not taken? Here
are enormous areas of territory full of natural
resources, with, in some cases, a mere handful
of folk to the square mile. Here are natural
pastures for cattle, lands which will produce fruits
and foods of every kind&mdash;figs, grapes and oranges,
cotton, coffee, cocoa, corn and wine and olives.
Not a variety of fruit, not a cereal, not a single
article of need for the comfort and use of the
settler is there that could not be produced. Here
are minerals of every kind known to commerce&mdash;gold,
silver, copper, lead and iron, and all the
non-metallic minerals&mdash;to be had for the working.</p>

<p>But above all, there are innumerable small
centres of population, of quiet and docile folk,
hungering for the presence of intelligent and
enterprising settlers who would look kindly upon
them, who would foster their local life, increase
the productivity of the neighbourhood, take part
in their civic and economic advancement.
Nowhere in the world is there such desire for
these things, nowhere is there such opportunity
for the settler for benefiting both himself and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
folk around him as is to be found in the innumerable
little villages and towns of Spanish America
hidden away in Cordillera, plain, valley and woodland.
There are literally myriads of such localities
scattered over the face of the Latin American
world, and I could give many instances from
personal experience.</p>

<p>The well-meaning foreigner in such places, with
some small capital, becomes one of the most
esteemed and predominant personages of the
locality. He could acquire and profit by flocks,
herds, plantations, mines. There is plenty of
labour, among the Indian and other folk, to be
obtained&mdash;labour, that is, in small local undertakings,
not for over-greedy or absorbent joint-stock
operations&mdash;under the relation of master and
servant. Here is an opportunity, then, for those
good English and other folk who complain so
hardly of heavy taxation and other burdens of life!
Any degree of climate may be chosen, from heat
to cold, including the "region of perpetual
spring," of which we have spoken elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is not intended here to advocate settlement
in Spanish America as against the British
colonies. The field is scarcely suitable for the
settler who has to depend upon his own labour,
without capital. He could not possibly compete
with the native. The difference is, that here are
innumerable old-established centres of population,
centres of civic life, and not, as in Canada or
Australia, vast areas of unsettled territory where
the lonely colonist is remote from social amenities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Moreover, with every desire to people the British
Empire with settlers from Britain, it is also to
be recollected that British settlers in Spanish
America increase the prestige&mdash;and incidentally
the trade&mdash;of Britain in those lands&mdash;matters which
should be encouraged. In Mexico, in better times,
there was something about the atmosphere and
environment that very strongly attracted the
American settler, and large numbers of people
from the United States established themselves in
the country&mdash;conditions which unfortunately do
not now exist.</p>

<p>In this connection we might ask ourselves a
serious question as regards Mexico. Have we,
the more advanced nations of the world, who
mainly by reason of climate and geography have
been blessed with a different temperament, made
any particular effort to help that country, or tried
to influence its people? We have invested our
money there, with the hope of dividends. We
have maintained our more or less starchy diplomatic
representatives. We have issued Foreign
Office Reports abounding in figures and pointing
out the ways of trade and the resources of the
land. But have we tried to influence the country
to a better life?</p>

<p>It may be replied that we could not readily
do so, that one country cannot mix itself up in
the affairs of another. But that is not a sufficient
answer. We have been content to take profits
from railways and mines, but among the rude and
picturesque hordes of Mexican miners, an impressionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and really industrious folk, there might
have been some good element at work maintained
by a little of the gold we won from them. Is
the mine manager or the book-keeper, busied
necessarily on the technical details of his post, the
only agent we might have kept there?</p>

<p>The same reflection may be made as regards
the other Latin American States, with a word of
warning to directors and shareholders. The native
miners are a hardy and often turbulent race. If
they were not hardy they would not be miners,
and if they were not headstrong they would not
be likely to undertake the onerous and dangerous
livelihood of the mines. These folk are, as
regards "labour" ideas, mostly ignorant and unorganized
at present. Directly they learn their
power, and directly some greater amount of education
filters in among them&mdash;accompanied, as is ever
the case, by socialistic or even anarchic ideas&mdash;they
will begin to demand their "rights." (The
nitrate-workers in Chile, for example). Such ideas
might spread very rapidly among these impressionable
folk, and they would be likely to stop
at nothing once the spark of disorder were
kindled, even to Bolshevism of the brown race.
Let us be wise in time and study the methods,
before too late, by which their lot may be improved
and their intelligence better directed under
a wider spirit of economic instruction and justice.
We may not like to face these eventualities, but
that will not influence the march of events.</p>

<p>The same holds good with every form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
foreign investment in Latin America&mdash;railways,
plantations and all else. So I would venture to
say, if we expect always to draw dividends from
our investments in Spanish America, let us wisely
have more regard to the social and economic
status of the worker. How, practically, that is to
be done is a question of our own intelligence.
Perhaps some advisory body might be instituted
in London, financed by the large British interests
in Latin America, such as would devote itself to
the study of the conditions of life surrounding
the workers in those lands, or at least as regards
their own employees. I offer this suggestion on
behalf of the poorer folk of these lands. They
generally look to the "Ingles" as a person of
influence&mdash;one, moreover, whose pockets are
always, they imagine, lined with silver! In their
way these folk believe that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noblesse oblige</i> (in
their own term for that concept) is a universal
axiom of the Englishman, and there is something
almost pathetic in this faith in a foreigner. Let
us beware that by negligence or greed we do not
forfeit this esteem. I offer the suggestion also
as a contributory safeguard to British investment
here.</p>

<p>Apart from the attitude of the individual worker
in these communities in relation to foreign capital,
we shall be well advised to keep in touch with
the attitude not only of the workers as a whole
but of the Governments which control national
affairs. Of late there have been certain indications
that a policy of antagonism towards foreign capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and enterprises is growing up. It has been very
marked in Mexico, but in Argentina, a much more
advanced community, and in the Brazilian States
it is at times disquieting. It is not so much antagonism,
however, as a feeling of dissatisfaction
that the earnings from national or public works
should go to foreign shareholders. The Argentine
railways of late years have felt a good deal this
disturbing element; as also the burden of
numerous strikes. British capital was the pioneer
in building railways in the republic, and has conferred
enormous benefit upon it. More than
15,000 miles of line are owned by British companies,
or three times as much as the remaining
mileage, which is French and national mainly.
Whilst these railways are, it is generally conceded,
worked and controlled as economically and efficiently
as ever, it cannot be said that they are
undertakings so profitable as should cause
envious eyes to be cast upon them. For
the past few years the average net return of
these British-owned railways in Argentina has
not exceeded the modest amount of three and
a half per cent. This is a low return, especially
for Argentina, where two or three times
the yield is obtained on ordinary safe mortgages
on houses and land. The British-owned banks
in South America may yield twenty per cent.
profit. Yet voices arise in the land, asking why
the transport of the country should be conducted
for the interests of foreign shareholders, and
begin to demand a larger share. A cry of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
kind soon becomes general, and when a government
has come into power on the strength of
popular promises&mdash;and to obtain votes and power
this condition arises now in South America, as in
all other lands&mdash;it has to attempt to carry out its
promises, and the line of least resistance here is
sometimes the foreign corporation. There is one
simple remedy which discontented governments
and folk here could apply&mdash;in purchasing for themselves
the shares of the railway companies in the
open market, but it does not appear that this
legitimate operation is much indulged in.</p>

<p>With regard to the native labour, it is to be
recollected that there are few (or no) laws to safeguard
it from exploitation by the employer. It
is only just beginning to learn how to combine
in its own interest. As I have shown in these
pages, it is in many instances and throughout the
whole region often over-exploited. The upper-class
employer, the Spanish American, does not
lack kindliness and charity, but it is contrary to
his custom and outlook to think much of the
labourer. The Spaniard and the Portuguese have
been oppressive in this connexion throughout
history.</p>

<p>Strikes in Argentina and Uruguay have of late
become very bitter in character, and bloodshed
generally occurs. Trains have been derailed and
passengers and drivers fired upon. It is to be
recollected that labour is not necessarily all of
the native stock, but is supplemented by the flow
from turbulent Spanish and Italian sources. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
poor Iberian or Calabrian comes over with a sense
of wrong against society, which in his own lands
he often has good reason to nourish, and which
he cannot throw aside on this new soil as readily
as he may the picturesque native costume of his
fatherland. In this respect we might indeed say&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coelum
non animum mutant qui trans mare
currunt</i>. The great estuary of the River Plate
receives in its haven many a discontented emigrant,
many an agitator from the Latin lands of
Europe, whose social defects, national and individual,
by a curious combination of circumstance,
many an English home&mdash;holder of shares in
Argentine and Brazilian railways&mdash;is, in a sense,
called upon to expiate!</p>

<p>There can be little doubt, moreover, that the
reins of power in certain South American States
tend to fall more and more into the hands of politicians
of a very democratic type&mdash;not to say
socialistic&mdash;and as the education of the "proletariat"
increases this element is likely to increase.
The Cabinet formed of "doctors," of
the upper and select strata of society, men of distinguished
type&mdash;but often out of touch and indeed
sympathy with the masses of their poorer countrymen&mdash;and
of military men, also of the upper strata,
is likely to be more and more diluted with the
ruder element who bears, sincerely or for political
purposes, the social wrongs of his constituents
as his creed. In brief, we may expect to see in
Latin America a wave of that unrest which now
has submerged Russia, perhaps Germany, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
which in some degree threatens every land. Let
us hope that, before it is too late, the channels of
human intelligence will flow with a true spirit of
humanity and the milk of human kindness and
order. But the general world-outlook is not encouraging,
and no doubt there is yet to be bitter
experience in these lands of Cancer and Capricorn,
of Central and South America, in the development
of their social affairs.</p>

<p>The relations of foreigners with the Latin
American people opens a wide field of discussion,
upon which we may lightly touch.</p>

<p>The social culture of these communities in the
past has been most greatly influenced by French
ideas, and France is still the ideal nation. It may
be that France, by reason of her apostasy and
her expulsion of the religious orders from her
shores in recent time, has lost prestige however.</p>

<p>The relations of the Americans of the United
States with the people of Latin America present
a number of interesting conditions and problems.
The two types of people and their civilizations
differ from each other in every respect, yet, neighbours
on the same continent and twin-continent,
they are and in the future will be more and more
thrown into contact with each other. The situation
is such as that which would arise if England
and Spain or England and France found themselves
with a common frontier, that of only a small
river, or the imaginary one of a parallel of latitude
between them. This is exemplified on the Mexico-United
States border, where the two races, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Spanish American and the Anglo-Saxon American&mdash;if
that term may be correctly applied to the
people of the United States&mdash;come into contact
but do not assimilate.</p>

<p>The first problem is one of nomenclature. The
people of the United States have arrogated to
themselves the name of "Americans," although, of
course, this belongs equally to all inhabitants of
the New World. The Latin Americans do not
necessarily agree with the pretension, and have
among themselves applied the term <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Norteamericanos</i>
to their northern neighbours&mdash;that is,
"North Americans." This alternates with the
term <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Yanquis</i>, the hispanicized form of the soubriquet
"Yankee," of doubtful origin; not, however,
necessarily used in a derogatory fashion, but
familiarly. The word <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> is also a common
term applied to the Americans; not, however,
to them alone, but to any foreigner not of Latin
race. The origin of this term is obscure, and it
cannot be said to be a flattering designation. The
word is often meant, however, as describing a
person whose hair and eyes are not dark, contrasting
thus with the general type of the Latin
American. Blue eyes and blonde hair are
essentially <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i>.</p>

<p>The Americans of the United States, as has
often been pointed out, are a people without a
distinctive or appropriate race name. The
Canadian, the Mexican, the Brazilian, the Peruvian
and all other units of America have their own
designation. So far no term for the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
has developed, and convenience warrants the usage
of that they have adopted, which is as if a single
nation of Europe were to take to itself the name
European. To the American aborigine, whether
in the Northern or Southern continent, ethnologists
have applied the term <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Amerind</i>, a contraction
of "American Indian," and the word seems
to have been adopted, at least as a technical term.
(No one, however, has applied the name "Amersaxon"
to the people of the United States,
although it would be equally correct.)</p>

<p>The relation between the two races, or rather
the common possession of the New World by
them, has given rise to that peculiar and well-known
policy or system known as the Monroe
Doctrine. Washington recommended the policy that
the United States should refrain from entangling
itself in the politics of Europe. The converse,
that Europe should be prevented from meddling
in American affairs, grew as the importance of
the United States increased, and was enunciated&mdash;after
a hint from Canning&mdash;by President
Monroe, in a message to Congress in 1823, at the
time of the "Holy Alliance" of European Powers,
which it was feared would attempt to restore
the dominion of Spain to the Spanish American
colonies, which had asserted their independence.
"We should consider any attempt on their part
(the European Powers) to extend their system to
any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to
our peace and safety. With the existing colonies
of any European Power we have not interfered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and shall not interfere. But with the Governments
who have declared their independence we could
not view any interposition for the purpose of
oppressing them or controlling their destiny by any
European Power in any other light than as the
manifestation of an unfriendly disposition towards
the United States." So ran the decree.</p>

<p>The Latin American States, whilst probably not
ungrateful for the Doctrine in general, resent any
assertion of hegemony upon the part of the
United States. They do not regard themselves
as in any way inferior thereto, except as concerns
the material development of the more mechanical
arts of civilization. Their own social culture, the
traditions of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caballero</i>, or gentleman, they consider
as superior, and if truth must be told, it is
so in some respects. The people of the United
States&mdash;and Canada&mdash;have preferred the less-polished
and more practical outlook and social
port; the Spanish American the more reserved
and ceremonious. Indeed, the southern folk often
regard the northerner as uncultured. There is no
doubt that the two races have a good deal to
learn from each other, the southerner in the practical
things of life, the northerner in social amenities,
and each could well absorb some of the virtues
of the other.</p>

<p>Until very recent times there was a disposition
on the part of the Spanish American people to
imagine the northerner as disposed to overrun
them, and there was an element in the United
States which undoubtedly had such purpose before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
it. But probably this is past, and the idea that
the Monroe Doctrine of "America for the
Americans" meant in reality "America for the
North Americans," may die out. The judicious
and generous attitude of the United States in Cuba
after the war between the United States and Spain
has been put against the methods employed, for
example, in the case of Panama and the Canal.
Mexico, however, remains a difficult question,
upon whose future relations with her neighbour
it would be impossible to dogmatize. The United
States at the present time are in the heyday of
their commercial life, and would appear to be
resolved to conquer the Latin American countries
commercially. This may or may not lead to strife
in the future. We shall not forget that the Great
War was, in large degree, the outcome of the
modern phase of commercial jealousy, and what
developments the future holds we cannot foresee.</p>

<p>We ought not to close our survey of the Latin
American nations without at least briefly recording
their attitude in the Great War, in the question
of right against might, of civilization against
German savagery. Far out of the beaten track
of European (and North American) affairs as are
these growing nations, their history in this connexion
might readily be forgotten, and its importance
overlooked.</p>

<p>It was not unnatural perhaps that the Latin
American Republics should have been tardy in
entering into the war, in view of the attitude of
the senior Republic of the Western Hemisphere&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
United States&mdash;which hung so long in the
balance. It did not at all follow that they would
imitate that country. In some respects they might
do so; in others they did not necessarily regard
their cousin of the north with entire confidence.
However, they were greatly influenced thereby.</p>

<p>The earlier attitude of the United States
towards the war must ever remain a source of
wonder to the historian, accompanied by regret.
It was largely, if not principally, the result of
the attitude of their President, Dr. Woodrow
Wilson. It will be recollected that the United
States did not enter the war against the German
barbarians until April, 1917&mdash;that is, over two and
a half years after the outbreak of the war. That
was the period necessary for the Republic to overcome
its own suspicion of Europe, and especially
England; to overcome its own self-interest, to
awaken to the truth; and this notwithstanding all
the horrors that had been visited upon Belgium.
Long after these dreadful occurrences had sunk
into the mind of the Allies, who, originally unprepared
for war, were fighting for their life in
support of humanity against the huge organized
army which Germany had for decades been building
up to carry out her ambitions, the American
President could send out his extraordinary Note
to all the belligerents (December, 1916) stating
that in his view "the objects on both sides appeared
to be the same." In plain words, the respective
merits of the combatants were as good or bad
as each other! In this view, however, to the credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
of the United States, it should be said that a
large body of Americans had a much clearer moral
perception of the issues at stake than their leader,
and among them was the vigorous ex-President,
Mr. Roosevelt. But it required a direct blow
in the face for the United States before the President
could shake off his pacifist attitude, and actual
injury to American property and life; and this
incentive was furnished by the German submarine
activity and the sinking of American ships. The
United States' interposition in the war had not
been asked for by England and the Allies at first,
but it had become evident long before that the
Republic should have ranged itself on the side of
law, order, and humanity; and America lost an
opportunity, which may never recur, of asserting
her moral influence in the world&mdash;a loss which, it
may be said, is hers as much as that of Europe.
The American interposition was of great value
when it did come, but the bulk of the work had
been done. America was almost too late to save
her prestige and to take efficient part in this
great adventure. When the Americans did enter
they displayed great energy and valour, and it
must also be recollected that the part the United
States had played in the supply of munitions of
war, foodstuffs, credit and so forth had been of
the utmost value, and there was more in this than
a mere business transaction.</p>

<p>The Latin American States did not necessarily
hasten to follow President Wilson's implied suggestion
of February, 1917, on severing diplomatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
relations with Germany, that the remaining neutral
States should follow suit, which no doubt was
largely aimed at the southern republics. There
were various reasons against it. Many of these
thought their own interests would best be served
by remaining neutral; some were afraid of Germany&mdash;it
was not unnatural. Some were angered
with France, for reasons later discussed; some
were&mdash;at least clerically&mdash;pro-German. On the
whole, however, it must be recorded that Latin
American sympathy as a whole was, and had been
from the beginning, on the side of the Allies.
It would indeed have augured ill for their moral
perception if the reverse had been the case, and
would have seriously injured them in the eyes of
historians.</p>

<p>Of these twenty independent Latin American
States, eight actually entered the war, on the side
of the Allies and the United States. They were
(in alphabetical order) Brazil, Costa Rica, Cuba,
Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua and
Panama. Five broke off relations with Germany
but did not declare war. They were Bolivia,
Ecuador, Peru, San Domingo (the <span id="Fix_286">Dominican</span>
Republic) and Uruguay. Peru and Uruguay were
practically belligerents, by their various acts
against Germany, but Germany did not appear so
to regard them. However, both these republics
were invited to the Peace Conference, and signed
the Peace Treaty. Seven republics remained
neutral. They were Argentina, Chile, Colombia,
Mexico, Paraguay, Salvador and Venezuela.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Putting the area of Latin America at nine
million square miles and the population at ninety
millions (of both these items various estimates are
given), it may be said that six million square
miles and fifty million people were at least non-neutral.</p>

<p>However, such figures must be taken for what
they were worth. Only Brazil and Cuba took any
active part. Argentina and Chile, the two most
important and powerful States after Brazil, carefully
preserved their neutral attitude. (It will be
recollected that the group of the three greatest
Powers of Latin America, which have been termed
the "A B C" Powers, are Argentina, Brazil and
Chile.) Mexico, the second largest State of Latin
America in point of population, was also neutral,
and at one time appeared to be strongly pro-German&mdash;an
attitude which was partly instrumental
in influencing the United States to take
up arms.</p>

<p>It must always be recollected, again, that the
official attitude of these States&mdash;as in the case
of the United States also, before it took part&mdash;did
not necessarily represent that of the majority
of the intelligent classes.</p>

<p>The actual entry of Brazil did not come until
October, 1917; that of Cuba came simultaneously
with that of the United States. Peru broke off
relations with Germany in October; Ecuador in
December; Bolivia in February (with the United
States); Uruguay in October; Panama at the
same period; Guatemala in April; Honduras and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Nicaragua in May; Costa Rica in September;
Haiti and San Domingo in July.</p>

<p>We may cast a glance at the various influences
at work in the respective attitudes of these States
towards the war.</p>

<p>Some of the States regarded with alarm the
possibilities of a German victory as such would
concern themselves. They had not forgotten that
their independence was largely a result of the
European outburst that followed the French
Revolution, nor yet the designs of Napoleon on
the Spanish American colonies and Brazil, which
England had helped to thwart, and those of Spain
and the Holy Alliance after Independence, which,
again, England and the United States had frustrated.
They knew Germany but for the Monroe
Doctrine&mdash;an Anglo-American creation&mdash;would
long ago have striven to help herself to South
American territory. On the other hand, German
propaganda had been especially active and sinister
among them during the war&mdash;business men and
professors&mdash;and the Germans had strong influence
there. Also Spanish and other clerical influences
were at work among them, often representing
France as the great atheist nation, due to her
anti-Church legislation and apostasy, and&mdash;for
example in Chile&mdash;it was even said that Germany
was the chosen instrument of heaven to punish
France on this account. Further, there was
always the smouldering distrust of the "Colossus
of the North," the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Norteamericanos</i> of the United
States, which it was often thought desired to exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
an undue hegemony over Latin America.
Colombia retained an animus against the United
States as a result of the Panama affair.</p>

<p>The most active spirit in Brazil on the side
of the right was the eminent Brazilian statesman,
Ruy Barbosa, and it was soon seen where the
sympathies of Brazil lay. Submarine outrages
on her merchant marine and other motives
brought forth pronouncements against the German
assassins, and the seizure of the large German
vessels in Brazilian ports followed, and both public
and official opinion led to the rupture. The
Brazilian Navy co-operated with that of the Allies,
and Brazil even sent forces to the Western front,
and the republic assisted with supplies. As for
Argentina, the war brought her enormous prosperity
as a neutral, but here the neutrality was
far more official than popular, and was largely
<span id="Fix_289">motivated</span> by the President. An episode in Argentina
was in the famous <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Spurlos Versenkt</i> Notes of
the unspeakable Luxburg, the German Chargé
d'Affaires in the republic, of May and July, 1917.
"As regards Argentine steamers," he wrote to his
Government&mdash;through the medium of the Swedish
Minister at Buenos Ayres, be it noted!&mdash;"I
recommend either compelling them to turn back,
letting them through, <em>or sinking them without
trace</em>." This devilishly cynical pronouncement
goes down to history with that of the infamous
German "scrap of paper" argument. Argentine
neutral citizens were to be murdered in cold blood
for German ends! The Minister received his passports,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the German club in Buenos Ayres was burnt
by the mob, and there was a popular demand for
a break with Germany; and the Senate passed
resolutions. But it ended in nothing. It has
been said that President Irrigoyen's extraordinary
attitude in opposing the popular mind was due
to pro-German feeling&mdash;which, however, was
denied; to his aversion from merely following in
the wake of the United States; and from a desire
to preserve Argentina from war in order that his
deep-seated plans of social and economic reform
might not be disturbed. Be it as it may, Argentina
lost her chance.</p>

<p>With regard to Chile, neutrality also was profitable,
in the enormous demand for her nitrates.
German influence was very strong in the country,
both in matters military and educational; and the
clerical attribute&mdash;the Church is powerful in Chile&mdash;was
also a factor, as before remarked. But
a large element viewed Germany with detestation,
and the republic "reserved its right to act in the
event of hostility against her vessels." However,
Chile also lost her opportunity.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that it was the submarine
policy of Germany in the direct attack upon
vessels which was the determining factor in all
these principal republics, from the United States
downward.</p>

<p>The attitude of Uruguay was always pro-Ally.
The Government of that country issued a noteworthy
decree in defining its position: that "no
American country, which, in defence of its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
rights, should find itself in a state of war with
nations of other continents will be treated as a
belligerent." It may be said in general terms
that the attitude of all these States proclaimed
the principle of "American solidarity," or Pan-Americanism.</p>

<p>The considerable element of British whose
homes or occupations are in Latin America followed
the varying fortunes of the war with eagerness,
for the name and fame of England is dear
to these exiled sons. Their hearts were broken
with the Tarapacá disaster to the British squadron,
but resuscitated by the great victory of the
Falkland Isles. It must not be forgotten that
they, in considerable number, left their homes and
occupations and came to England as volunteers
early in the war. They were not grouped together
as a separate force, being of so scattered an origin.
But the King approved a special badge for them,
and England should be grateful for their noble
effort&mdash;we trust she was and is!</p>

<p>The effect of the war upon the Latin American
States&mdash;whilst it cut off supplies at first of
European manufactured goods and disorganized
exchange and currency&mdash;was to cause an enormous
demand for their raw materials, with corresponding
increase of wealth. Even the first-named condition
was a benefit in disguise, causing a development
of home manufacture.</p>

<p>German trade in South America, for the time
being, was ruined&mdash;a severe blow&mdash;a result of the
British blockade. British and French trade of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
course suffered temporarily. The trade of the
United States, on the other hand, increased:
American goods replaced European, and it seemed
at one time that the change might be permanent;
but it was found that their goods were
inferior, or at any rate less acceptable, than those
of the older exporters. However, new horizons&mdash;trade,
banking and so forth&mdash;opened in Latin
America for the United States.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that the two American peoples
know very much of each other. The aloofness is
partly from geographical, partly from racial
causes. Enormous distances separate their respective
principal centres of life. New York and
the city of Mexico, for example, are several
thousand miles apart, although linked by more
than one railway system. Huge deserts intervene,
those dreadful wildernesses of Northern Mexico,
on whose existence, indeed, an early president of
Mexico, who distrusted the northern neighbour,
was wont to congratulate his country, summing up
the sentiment in his aphorism of "Between weakness
and strength&mdash;the Desert!" As for communication
by sea, it may be recollected that
Europe is more accessible to, for example, Brazil
and Argentina, than is New York. On the Pacific
side of the continent the greater part of a hemisphere
intervenes between the large centres of
population of North and South America. From
San Francisco, or other great seaports, to Callao
and Valparaiso the steamer voyage occupies far
more time than is necessary to cross the Atlantic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
The people of Peru and Chile or Ecuador, and
the people of California or Oregon are little more
than names to each other, inhabitants of another
world. Great stretches of undeveloped territory
intervene, and through communication by rail
has not yet been established, as the Pan-American
Railway remains still on the lap of
the future.</p>

<p>Among those nations which in the future may
be reckoned upon as likely to display a desire
for closer relations with Spanish America are the
Chinese and the Japanese. The Mongolians seem
to have&mdash;as before remarked&mdash;some affinity with
the American Indian race, possibly by reason of
some very ancient kinship or common ancestry,
for it is held by ethnologists that America may
have been very early peopled by Mongolians. In
Peru, for example, the Chinaman readily establishes
himself in business in the smaller villages
(and often surrounds himself with several wives
or female companions from among the Indian
women). The Japanese have long cast eyes upon
the upper reaches of the Amazon basin, or
Montaña, of Peru and Brazil, for purposes of
settlement and industry, and of late a company
from Nippon has acquired a large tract of land
there, with such an object. These folk are not unwelcome,
or not so far, by the South Americans,
who are desirous of seeing these vast and sparsely
inhabited regions brought to life.</p>

<p>This possibility of a modern Mongolian "invasion"
into the heart of South America is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
which may take on greater importance in the
future.</p>

<p>In general terms, however, it must be recollected
that the Pacific Ocean is vast and wide. There
is, nevertheless, a school of thought arising of late
which affects to believe that the Pacific Ocean is
destined to become the centre of the world's commercial
activity. As this centre changed, they say,
from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, so will it
change from the Atlantic to the Pacific. They
regard the "basin" of the Pacific as a sort of
entity, and look for enormous developments in this
respect, of fleets bearing travellers and merchandise,
of great interchange of products and so
forth.</p>

<p>Whilst this view may be well-founded, I
venture to think that certain natural factors have
not been sufficiently taken into account. There is,
first, the condition of enormous width from the
Asiatic to the American shore; second, it is not
sufficiently understood that this American shore,
whether in North or South America, is in the
nature of a narrow strip of land greatly cut off
from the interior of the continents by vast
mountain ranges and deserts. In North America
the Sierra Nevadas and the Great American Desert
have to be crossed between California and the
eastern and central part of the United States, and
the Rocky Mountains in Oregon and British
Columbia, whilst in Mexico the Western Sierra
Madre offers a similar obstacle. In South
America, as we have seen, the Andes is a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
mountain wall, cutting off the interior absolutely
from the narrow and comparatively infertile Pacific
littoral. The natural outlet of the vast area of
South America is to the east; it falls to the
Atlantic, not to the Pacific. Where, then, are the
people and the products that would give rise to so
great a movement upon the Pacific Ocean?</p>

<p>Lastly, I am inclined to doubt (although I may
be in error) whether the future of the world is to
show a vast increase in overseas trade and trafficking
such as would change its centre of gravity in
this respect. There are factors against such&mdash;as
have been discussed in the chapter dealing with
trade; factors of the natural development of self-supply,
as against import of commodities, factors
of the huge and increasing cost of transport,
scarcity of fuel and so forth. Moreover, what
does Asia want from America, or America from
Asia? Both continents produce the things of the
temperate and the tropic zones; both are capable
of manufacturing the finished goods which they
require.</p>

<p>Taking all these matters into consideration, it
may be doubted if the Pacific Ocean is to attain
to the great importance which some have imagined
for it, although doubtless its traffic will increase.</p>

<p>A glance now towards the future of these great
lands beneath the Southern American sun, and
our task will be done. What is to be their future;
what part are they to play in the great scene-shifting
of the developing world?</p>

<p>First we shall have remarked that the Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
American people are material in the making. They
are not a worn-out race; they are, rather,
unformed, plastic, with their life before them.
Second, they inhabit perhaps the richest portion
of the surface of the globe, which, so far from
being exhausted, has not been heavily drawn upon
in some respects. It is true that coal, that adjunct
of the civilization of the industrial age, is not
plentiful (except in certain districts). But the
future may not be so largely dependent upon this
mineral. Possibly, moreover, Nature had a purpose
in the absence of coal, ordaining that at least
one of the world's continents should not undergo
the terrors of the factory age!</p>

<p>Let us turn now to certain more general
conditions.</p>

<p>The growth of the Latin American republics
might seem to offer a future for the growth and
even regeneration (and some writers have said the
predominance again) of the Latin races in the
world generally. Here, at least, is an enormous
territory, some of the richest and most fertile on
the globe, at present but thinly inhabited. By
the close of the present century it might be that
South America would contain 250 million people.
A century ago there were but 15 millions. Of
course the enormous growth of the population in
Europe and the United States has been a result
of the machine, or industrial age&mdash;by no means an
unmixed good. This has depended upon the resources
of coal, iron and so forth in their soils,
and statistics and forecasts show that these resources,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
under the present system of depletion and
waste, especially in England and the United
States, will tend to exhaustion in a few generations.
Whether that will lead to a corresponding
decline in population remains to be seen, but in
this and other respects it may be said that coming
events cast their shadows before. Probably the
greatest reproach that can be placed upon Anglo-Saxon
life to-day is that we are drawing heavily
upon the exhaustible resources of the earth without
establishing the basis of a permanent or adequate
civilization.</p>

<p>It should be urged that the time has come when
we should take a more comprehensive, judicious
and constructive outlook upon the world&mdash;its
natural resources and its folk. We are inclined to
think that Nature's resources, because partly unexplored
here and there, are "exhaustless." The
Spanish American people are fond of speaking
of their <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">inagotable riqueza natural</i>&mdash;their "inexhaustible
natural resources"; but these are not inexhaustible,
as I have elsewhere remarked. We
need a survey, a stocktaking, of the earth's
resources; we need to conserve, to economize
them. It is a remarkable fact, however, that the
latest pronouncement of the League of Nations
contains no idea or suggestion of a fundamental
policy of retrenchment, conservation, development
of these potentialities. The pronouncement, which
seems to be largely an echo of President Wilson's
original "Fourteen Points"&mdash;which doubtless had
among them certain merits at the time of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
enunciation&mdash;does not get beyond advocating "increased
production," the "entire removal of all
economic barriers," in this respect. In brief, it is
the old dreary doctrine, largely, of creating and
selling, of forcing goods on communities and folk
who do not necessarily need them, without any
scientific outlook upon the native potentialities and
requirements, or the world's natural divisions&mdash;a
dreadful "internationalism" which we hoped was
declining. The League of Nations, as regards
its economic knowledge and spirit, is a magnificent
opportunity wasted, or will be so unless it
develops into something far more fundamentally
intelligent. This matter of outlook by so important
a body is of vital importance to the Latin
American States, as to all others. The exploitation
of the great remaining natural resources of
these countries&mdash;as is the case with many others&mdash;cannot
be successfully done under the present relations
of labour and capital. Capital must have its
fair reward, labour must be fairly paid; but the two
things at present clash, and we shall have to find
the way out before the enormous, but not fruitless,
wilderness of South America and Mexico can yield
up what they contain. The cream of the earth's
resources has been skimmed everywhere; the
remainder calls for much more scientific consideration.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is impossible to forecast what the
future of the world&mdash;which has been shaken to
its foundations by recent events&mdash;is to be. Civilization
may advance or it might recede, or hang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
fire for centuries. That depends upon the efforts
and the conscience of mankind. It may be that
a quieter, less strenuous life awaits it, with less of
material activity and more of moral and intellectual
growth. In fact, some of us who have studied the
world in its economic and political aspects, will
doubt if the present type of civilization has not
reached its apogee and is to enter on some other
phase, a phase which we believe and hope is to be
of the nature indicated.</p>

<p>If that be so, there is no reason why the Latin
American States should not acquire growing importance.
The character of their more thoughtful
and educated classes is towards such a life, whilst
the resources of Nature they command could afford
them everything needful for their existence. The
Spanish American lands have been dowered with
every variety of climate and product, and by going
up or down their valleys their folk can gather
every known food-product or thing of the animal,
vegetable and mineral world.</p>

<p>As to their character for national turbulence, it
has been shown in these pages that such disturbing
influences are but the activities of a relatively small
class. Their ideals are high, their aim is towards
a high civilization. Some of the nations of the
Old World that considered themselves foremost in
civilization&mdash;such as Germany and Austria&mdash;have
shown by their actions that they can fall lower
in barbarity than any of the most backward nations.
Moreover, all nations are restless, all their cultures
are in the melting-pot, all are at fault. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
must be regeneration and reconstruction everywhere.</p>

<p>The future of the world will be in the
exercise of true spiritual factors, interwoven
with or influencing what I have, elsewhere,
ventured to term ethical-economic constructive
principles.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> From a wise consideration of these,
there must emerge a "science of corporate
life," or science of humanity, which will learn
to build up the true "economic structure" of
society, in conjunction with its intellectual and
spiritual activities&mdash;a constructive human geography,
which will aim at the true and final
reaction of mankind from its environment. Elemental
forces are at work, for good or ill, at the
present time, and elemental forces must be met
by fundamental principles. One nation to-day is
almost as far from such a philosophy as another,
although to-morrow might see the turning of a
page which should disclose its beginnings. In this
evolving book of life the Latin American
Republics have their opportunity, as far as the
possible exercise of principle goes, with all other
nations.</p>

<p>The problem for these nations is to bring on
their own culture, avoiding, if possible, the errors of
Europe and the United States: that is, avoiding
the factors of industrial unrest and economic waste
that have accompanied progress. They could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
profit by example and experience gained by these
other lands: to bring on the education and economic
uplifting of the backward masses of their
people, not by crowding them into factories or
refusing them a living wage, not by drawing so
heavily on their fruitful soils as to begin to exhaust
these, but by methods more in accordance with
those principles which alone can ensure permanence
and nobility.</p>

<p>We have seen that the Latin American nations
have been dowered by Providence with everything
that could make a people prosperous and contented,
if wisely disposed. In some respects their
circumstances are superior to those of Europe and
Asia. They have no over-powerful or rapacious
neighbours, no chasms of race or religion to
divide them, no insensate trade rivalries&mdash;things
such as in the Old World have wrought such
havoc with mankind. To the traveller who has
sojourned in these lands it will always remain
a matter of interest to see how their lives develop,
what fortune or vicissitudes befall them. Under
any circumstances, they offer a field of abiding
interest&mdash;scenic, natural, antiquarian&mdash;and their
folk are likely ever to retain the traits which
attract us. Commerce and business will doubtless
grow and expand between them and the Old
World, or their neighbours of the United States,
with corresponding benefits, but there are many
features of the region which fortunately will never
fall under the domain of business. One thing,
again, which humanity needs is more intercourse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
and Latin America is too remote from us. Books
are useful, but there should be a greater interflow
of people. Unfortunately, it is a feature of life
now that travel becomes more rather than less
expensive, and we do not know what the future
may hold for or against the traveller in this
connexion.</p>

<p>This circumstance, also, is one of those which
await the more logical outlook and constructive
ability of mankind, concerning the things by
which we live and move and have our being.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such, then, is the romance, reality and future of
these interesting lands of the Spanish American
world, as far as it has been possible to depict
them in these pages.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> There is an indication that British Guiana is itself awakening
to the need for exerting itself, in order to bring itself before
the notice of a somnolent Mother Country. A deputation arrived
in England from the colony in the middle of 1919 charged with
the purpose of interviewing the Secretaries for the Colonies
and Indian Government, and they went through a course of
dinners, meetings and lectures, in which the customary excellent
speeches were made. Certain of the speakers made the asservations
that British Guiana "could supply all the meat, except
mutton, consumed in the Mother Country," and sugar and
minerals received equal notice, whilst gold, diamonds and
bauxite&mdash;an ore of aluminium&mdash;were also dangled, metaphorically
speaking, before the Imperial-minded diners.
</p>
<p>
To produce these excellent matters, five thousand settlers
per annum are required, the word settler being employed as
a well-meaning term for coloured labour. There must be a
flow of British capital too. But British capital has not very
readily been forthcoming. It can be spared for enterprises
anywhere in Spanish America, even "wild-cat" schemes, but
not for Guiana, apparently.</p></div>

<p><span class="xlargefont">ZANZIBAR: The Island Metropolis</span>
of Eastern Africa. By Major <span class="smcap">Francis B.
Pearce</span>, C.M.G. (British Resident in Zanzibar).
With a Map and 32 pages Illustrations. Super
Royal 8vo, cloth. 30s. net. [Second Impression.</p>

<p>This important work deals with the past and present history
of Zanzibar. From the earliest times this island, owing to its
commanding position off the coast of Africa, controlled the
great trade-routes which traversed the Continent from the
Indian to the Atlantic Oceans, and it has remained to the present
day the Metropolis of the East African Region. It has known
many over-lords, and the author, who is His Majesty's Representative
in Zanzibar, traces the story of this romantic island-kingdom
down the centuries. The close association of this African
island with ancient and mediæval Arabia is demonstrated, and the
advent of the old Persian colonists to its shores explained.
Coming to later times such names as Vasco da Gama and
Sir James Lancaster, that famous Elizabethan sea-captain, are
met with; until leaving beaten tracks, the author introduces
the reader to the hoary kingdom of Oman, whence come those
princes of the Arabian desert who subdued to their sway the
rich spice-island of Zanzibar and the adjacent territories of
Central Africa. Modern Zanzibar is fully dealt with, and the
enlightened Prince who occupies the throne of Zanzibar to-day
is introduced to the reader in a personal interview. The
latter portion of the work is devoted to descriptions of the
ruined Arab and Persian stone-built towns&mdash;the very names
of which are now forgotten&mdash;which, until cleared by the
author, lay mouldering in the forests of Zanzibar and Pemba.
The text is elucidated by a series of beautiful photographs,
and by specially prepared maps. This volume must be regarded
as the standard work on the Sultanate of Zanzibar.</p>

<p><span class="xlargefont">MODERN JAPAN: Its Political,</span>
Military, and Industrial Organization. By
<span class="smcap">William Montgomery McGovern</span>, Ph.D.,
M.R.A.S., F.R.A.I., etc., Lecturer on Japanese,
School of Oriental Studies (Univ. of Lond.),
Priest of the Nishi Hongwanji Kyoto,
Japan. 15s. net.</p>

<p>Unlike the book of casual impressions by the tourist or globe-trotter,
or a tedious work of reference for the library, Mr.
McGovern's book on "Modern Japan" gives for the average
educated man an interesting description of the evolution of Japan
as a modern world Power, and describes the gradual triumphs over
innumerable obstacles which she accomplished. The book relates
how the Restoration of 1867 was carried out by a small coterie of
ex-Samurai, in whose hands, or in that of their successors, political
power has ever since remained. We see portrayed the perfecting
of the Bureaucratic machine, the general, political and institutional
history, the stimulation of militarism and Imperialism and
centralized industry. It is a vivid account of the real Japan of
to-day, and of the process by which it has become so. Though
comprehensible to the non-technical reader, yet the more careful
student of Far Eastern affairs will find much of value in the acute
analysis of the Japanese nation. The author is one who has
resided for years in Japan, was largely educated there, who was in
the Japanese Government service, and who, by his fluent knowledge
of the language, was in intimate contact with all the leading
statesmen of to-day. Furthermore, his position as priest of the
great Buddhist Temple of Kyoto brought him in touch with
phases of Japanese life most unusual for a European. While
neither pro- nor anti-Japanese, he has delineated the extraordinary
efficiency of the machine of State (so largely
modelled on Germany), while, at the same time, he has
pointed out certain dangers inherent in its autocratic bureaucracy.</p>

<p><span class="xlargefont">BELGIUM: From the Roman Invasion</span>
to the Present Day. By <span class="smcap">Emile
Cammaerts</span>. With several Maps and many
Illustrations. Large crown 8vo., cloth. 7s. 6d. net.</p>

<p>A complete history of the Belgian nation from its origins to its
present situation has not yet been published in this country. Up
till now Belgian history has only been treated as a side issue in
works concerned with Belgian art, Belgian literature or social
conditions. Besides, there has been some doubt with regard to
the date at which such a history ought to begin, and a good many
writers have limited themselves to the modern history of Belgium
because they did not see in olden times sufficient evidence of
Belgian unity. According to the modern school of Belgian
historians, however, this unity, founded on common traditions and
common interests, has asserted itself again and again through the
various periods of history in spite of invasion, foreign domination
and the various trials experienced by the country. The history
of the Belgian nation appears to the modern mind as a slow
development of one nationality constituted by two races speaking
two different languages, but bound together by geographical,
economic and cultural conditions. In view of the recent proof
Belgium has given of her patriotism during the world-war, this
impartial inquiry into her origins may prove interesting to
British readers. Every opportunity has been taken to insist on
the frequent relationships between the Belgian provinces and
Great Britain from the early Middle Ages to the present time
and to show the way in which both countries were affected by
them. Written by one of the most distinguished Belgian
writers, who has made a speciality of his subject, this work
will be one of the most brilliant and informing contributions
in "The Story of the Nations" (now numbering sixty-seven
volumes), a series which has achieved a world-wide reputation.</p>

<p class="center xlargefont">THE ADVANCE <em>of</em> SOUTH AMERICA</p>

<p><em>A few notes on some interesting books dealing with the past
history, present and future possibilities of the great Continent.</em></p>

<p>When in 1906 Mr. Fisher Unwin commissioned the
late Major Martin Hume to prepare a series of
volumes by experts on the South American Republics,
but little interest had been taken in the
country as a possible field for commercial development.
The chief reasons for this were ignorance as
to the trade conditions and the varied resources of
the country, and the general unrest and unstability of
most of the governments. With the coming of the
South American Series of handbooks the financial
world began to realize the importance of the country,
and, with more settled conditions, began in earnest
to develop the remarkable natural resources which
awaited outside enterprise. Undoubtedly the most
informative books on the various Republics are those
included in <span class="smcap">The South American Series</span>, each of which
is the work of a recognized authority on his subject.</p>

Museum of Natural History. With 48 Full-page
Illustrations and with Maps. Cloth, 21/- net.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This volume represents a series of almost continuous
explorations hardly ever paralleled in the huge areas
traversed. The author is a distinguished field
naturalist&mdash;one of those who accompanied Colonel
Roosevelt on his famous South American expedition&mdash;and
his first object in his wanderings over 150,000
miles of territory was the observation of wild life;
but hardly second was that of exploration. The
result is a wonderfully informative, impressive and
often thrilling narrative in which savage peoples
and all but unknown animals largely figure, which
forms an infinitely readable book and one of rare value
for geographers, naturalists and other scientific men.</p></blockquote>
